## 🔧 Preprocessing

The preprocessing pipeline (`preprocess.py` - 7 KB) implements a comprehensive data cleaning and preparation workflow.

### 1. Text Cleaning Operations

#### URL Removal
- **Pattern**: `http\S+|www\.\S+`
- **Purpose**: Removes web links that don't contribute to text style analysis
- **Example**: `"Check this out: https://example.com"` → `"Check this out:"`

#### Email Removal
- **Pattern**: `\S+@\S+`
- **Purpose**: Strips email addresses for privacy and relevance
- **Example**: `"Contact me at user@example.com"` → `"Contact me at"`

#### Whitespace Normalization
- **Operation**: Converts multiple spaces, tabs, and newlines to single spaces
- **Purpose**: Ensures consistent text formatting
- **Example**: `"Hello    world\n\n"` → `"Hello world"`

#### Null Value Handling
- **Operation**: Converts null/NaN values to empty strings
- **Purpose**: Prevents processing errors

### 2. Data Quality Control

#### Empty Text Removal
- Filters out samples with no content after cleaning
- Ensures all training samples have meaningful text

#### Duplicate Removal
- Uses `drop_duplicates(subset=['text'], keep='first')`
- Eliminates exact text duplicates to prevent data leakage
- Keeps only the first occurrence of duplicate texts

#### Label Validation
- Ensures all samples have valid binary labels (0 or 1)
- Removes any rows with missing or invalid labels

### 3. Class Balancing Technique

#### Random Equal Sampling
- **Method**: Randomly samples equal numbers from each class
- **Formula**: `samples_needed = min(count_human, count_ai)`
- **Implementation**: 
  ```python
  human_samples = df[df['label'] == 0].sample(n=samples_needed, random_state=42)
  ai_samples = df[df['label'] == 1].sample(n=samples_needed, random_state=42)
  ```

#### Adaptive Sample Sizing
- Automatically adjusts to the minority class size
- Prevents class imbalance issues during training
- Ensures model doesn't learn to predict majority class by default

#### Reproducibility
- Uses fixed random seed (42) for consistent results
- Enables reproducible experiments and debugging

### 4. Stratified Dataset Splitting

#### Two-Step Splitting Process
1. **First Split**: Separates training data from (validation + test)
   ```python
   train_df, temp_df = train_test_split(
       balanced_df,
       test_size=0.5,
       stratify=balanced_df['label'],
       random_state=42
   )
   ```

2. **Second Split**: Divides remaining data into validation and test
   ```python
   val_df, test_df = train_test_split(
       temp_df,
       test_size=0.5,
       stratify=temp_df['label'],
       random_state=42
   )
   ```

#### Stratification Benefits
- Maintains exact 50:50 class distribution in all splits
- Ensures representative samples in train, validation, and test sets
- Prevents evaluation bias from imbalanced test sets

### Preprocessing Output
After running `preprocess.py`, you get:
- Three balanced CSV files in `processed_data/`
- Statistics report showing sample counts and label distributions
- Clean, deduplicated data ready for model training

## 🧠 Model Architecture

### Base Model: RoBERTa

#### What is RoBERTa?
**RoBERTa** (Robustly Optimized BERT Approach) is an improved version of BERT developed by Facebook AI. It's a transformer-based model that learns contextual representations of text.

#### Model Specifications
- **Architecture**: RoBERTa-base
- **Parameters**: ~125 million trainable parameters
- **Tokenizer**: Byte-level Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)
- **Max Sequence Length**: 512 tokens

3. **Balanced Performance**: Both classes show >97% performance across all metrics
4. **Production Ready**: Error rate of 1.31% is excellent for real-world deployment

#### Model Behavior Patterns
1. **Conservative Bias**: Model slightly favors AI detection when uncertain
   - False positive rate (1.14%) > False negative rate (0.17%)
   - Ratio: ~6.7:1 in favor of false positives
   
2. **Text Length Correlation**:
   - Misclassified texts average 2,460 characters
   - Correctly classified texts average 2,242 characters
   - Longer texts show slightly more ambiguity

3. **Detection Philosophy**: 
   - Better to flag a human text for review (false positive)
   - Than to miss AI-generated content (false negative)
   - This bias is intentional and beneficial for most use cases

#### System Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Python Version**: 3.7 or higher (3.8+ recommended)
- **RAM**: Minimum 8GB (16GB recommended for training)
- **Storage**: At least 5GB free space
- **GPU** (Optional): NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support for faster training

#### Required Software
- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git (for cloning repository)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/manivardhan623/Detect-AI.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd Detect-AI
```

### Step 2: Install Python Dependencies

#### Option A: Direct Installation
```bash
pip install torch transformers pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn tqdm nltk
```

#### Option B: Using requirements.txt (Recommended)

Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

```txt
torch>=1.9.0
transformers>=4.20.0
pandas>=1.3.0
numpy>=1.21.0
scikit-learn>=0.24.0
matplotlib>=3.4.0
seaborn>=0.11.0
tqdm>=4.62.0
nltk>=3.6.0
```

Then install:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Option C: Using Virtual Environment (Best Practice)

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Download NLTK Data

The preprocessing script uses NLTK for text tokenization. Download required data:

```bash
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt')"
```

Or the script will automatically download it on first run.

### Step 4: Prepare Dataset

Place your `AI_Human.csv` dataset in the `Original_data/` folder:

```bash
# Ensure the folder structure
mkdir -p Original_data
# Copy your dataset
cp /path/to/your/AI_Human.csv Original_data/
```

### Step 5: Model Files Setup

⚠️ **Important**: The trained model files (model.safetensors) are too large for GitHub.

#### Option A: Train Your Own Model (Recommended)
```bash
# Run preprocessing first
python preprocess.py

# Then train the model
python train.py
```

This will:
- Download RoBERTa-base from Hugging Face automatically
- Fine-tune it on your preprocessed data
- Save the trained model to `ensemble_models/roberta-base/`

#### Option B: Use Pre-trained Model
If you have access to pre-trained model files:
1. Create the model directory: `mkdir -p ensemble_models/roberta-base/`
2. Place all model files in `ensemble_models/roberta-base/`
3. Ensure you have: config.json, vocab.json, merges.txt, tokenizer files, and model.safetensors

### Verification

```bash
# Check Python version
python --version

# Check if PyTorch is installed with CUDA (if you have GPU)
python -c "import torch; print(f'PyTorch: {torch.__version__}'); print(f'CUDA Available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}')"

# Check if Transformers is installed
python -c "import transformers; print(f'Transformers: {transformers.__version__}')"
```

Expected output:
```
Python 3.8.x
PyTorch: 1.9.x
CUDA Available: True  (or False if no GPU)
Transformers: 4.20.x
```

## ⚠️ Limitations

### 1. Text Length Dependency

**Issue**: Model performance degrades with shorter texts

| Text Length | Expected Accuracy |
|------------|-------------------|
| < 50 words | ~85-90% |
| 50-150 words | ~92-95% |
| 150-500 words | ~97-98% |
| > 500 words | **98-99%** |

**Recommendation**: Use at least 150 words for reliable detection

**Why**: Shorter texts provide insufficient context for pattern recognition

### 2. Training Data Distribution Bias

**Issue**: Model performs best on text similar to training data

**Training Data Characteristics**:
- General essays and articles
- Various topics and domains
- Standard English grammar and structure
- Mix of formal and informal styles

**May struggle with**:
- Highly technical/specialized content
- Non-standard dialects or slang
- Code-switched text (multiple languages)
- Domain-specific jargon

**Mitigation**: Retrain or fine-tune on domain-specific data if needed

### 3. Language Limitation

**Current Status**: Optimized for English text only

**Performance on other languages**:
- Untested and likely unreliable
- Model tokenizer built for English
- Training data exclusively English

**Future Work**: Multi-lingual model development needed

### 4. AI Model Evolution

**Issue**: Newer AI models may evade detection

**Current Detection Based On**:
- Patterns from existing AI models (GPT-2, GPT-3 era)
- Trained on data available up to training date

**Risk Factors**:
- Future AI models may write more human-like text
- Detection arms race between generators and detectors
- Model may become outdated over time

**Maintenance Required**:
- Regular retraining with new AI-generated samples
- Continuous evaluation against latest AI models
- Dataset updates to include newer AI outputs

### 5. Edge Cases and Special Scenarios

#### Formal Human Writing
**Issue**: Very polished human writing may be flagged as AI
- Academic papers with perfect grammar
- Professional editor-reviewed content
- Highly structured technical documentation

**False Positive Rate**: 1.14% for such content

#### Casual AI Generation
**Issue**: AI attempting informal style may evade detection
- AI trained to mimic conversational tone
- Intentionally imperfect AI outputs
- AI with randomness/creativity parameters

**False Negative Rate**: 0.17% for such content

#### Mixed Human-AI Content
**Issue**: Cannot detect collaborative human-AI writing
- Human-edited AI drafts
- AI-assisted human writing
- Paragraph-level mixing

**Limitation**: Model outputs binary classification, not percentage estimation

### 6. Short Text Unreliability

**Problem**: Texts under 50 words show degraded performance

**Examples of Problematic Short Texts**:
- Social media posts
- Email snippets
- Single paragraphs
- Headlines and titles

**Why**: Insufficient linguistic features for analysis

**Workaround**: Combine multiple short texts for analysis

### 7. Context and Intent Limitations

**Cannot Detect**:
- **Purpose**: Whether text is for academic vs creative use
- **Authorship**: Who wrote it (specific person)
- **Timestamp**: When it was written
- **Source Model**: Which AI model generated it
- **Editing History**: How much human editing occurred

**Only Detects**: Binary classification (Human vs AI origin)

### 8. Domain-Specific Challenges

#### Scientific/Technical Text
- Both humans and AI use similar formal structures
- Specialized vocabulary may confuse model
- Citation patterns and formatting

#### Creative Writing
- AI can mimic various creative styles
- Human creativity ranges widely
- Genre-specific patterns

#### Social Media Content
- Abbreviated language and slang
- Emoji and special characters
- Platform-specific conventions

### 9. Adversarial Attacks

**Potential Vulnerabilities**:
- Intentional obfuscation techniques
- Strategic word substitutions
- Grammar manipulation
- Style transfer attacks

**Not Tested Against**: Sophisticated adversarial examples

### 10. Ethical Considerations

**Fairness Concerns**:
- May disadvantage non-native English speakers
- Could penalize those with different writing styles
- Potential bias against certain demographic groups

**Privacy**: Requires access to full text content

**Recommendation**: Always use as one tool among many, never sole decision-maker

### Usage Guidelines Given Limitations

✅ **DO**:
- Use for initial screening/flagging
- Combine with other detection methods
- Review flagged content manually
- Update model regularly
- Test on your specific use case

❌ **DON'T**:
- Make final decisions based solely on model output
- Use on languages other than English
- Apply to very short texts without caution
- Assume 100% accuracy
- Use for high-stakes decisions without human review

### Feature Extraction Approach

#### Transformer-Based Embeddings

**No Manual Feature Engineering**:
- Automatic feature learning through transformer attention
- Contextual word representations (not static embeddings)
- Position-aware encoding
- Attention mechanism captures relationships

**Tokenization Process**:
```
Input Text
    ↓
Byte-level BPE Tokenization
    ↓
Token IDs [101, 2023, 3456, ..., 102]
    ↓
RoBERTa Embeddings (768-dimensional)
    ↓
Contextual Representations
```

**Feature Dimensions**:
- Input: Variable-length text (up to 512 tokens)
- Hidden States: 768 dimensions per token
- Final Representation: 768-dimensional [CLS] token
- Output: 2-dimensional (Human vs AI probabilities)

### Training Methodology

#### Fine-Tuning Strategy

**Transfer Learning Approach**:
1. Start with pre-trained RoBERTa-base weights
2. Add classification head (768 → 2 dimensions)
3. Fine-tune entire model on binary classification task
4. Preserve pre-trained language understanding

**Training Configuration**:
```python
Model: RoBERTa-base
Task: Binary Sequence Classification
Input: Text sequences (up to 512 tokens)
Output: 2 classes (0=Human, 1=AI)
Loss Function: Cross-Entropy Loss
Optimizer: AdamW (standard for transformers)
Device: Automatic (CUDA if available, else CPU)
```

#### Optimization Details

**AdamW Optimizer**:
- Adaptive learning rate per parameter
- Weight decay for regularization
- Bias correction for unbiased estimates
- Standard choice for transformer fine-tuning

**Training Process**:
```python
for epoch in epochs:
    for batch in train_dataloader:
        # Forward pass
        outputs = model(input_ids, attention_mask)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        
        # Backward pass
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
```

### Evaluation Methodology

#### Classification Metrics

**Precision (Positive Predictive Value)**:
```
Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
```
- Measures accuracy of positive predictions
- "When we predict AI, how often are we correct?"

**Recall (Sensitivity, True Positive Rate)**:
```
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
```
- Measures ability to find all positive cases
- "What percentage of AI texts do we catch?"

**F1-Score (Harmonic Mean)**:
```
F1 = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
```
- Balances precision and recall
- Single metric for model comparison

**Accuracy**:
```
Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
```
- Overall correctness percentage

#### Confusion Matrix Analysis

**Matrix Structure**:
```
                Predicted
              Human    AI
Actual Human   TN      FP
       AI      FN      TP
```

**Derived Metrics**:
- True Negative Rate (Specificity): TN / (TN + FP)
- False Positive Rate: FP / (TN + FP)
- False Negative Rate: FN / (TP + FN)

#### Error Pattern Analysis

**Text Length Correlation**:
```python
# Calculate average length of misclassified texts
misclassified = predictions[predictions['label'] != predictions['predicted']]
avg_length_errors = misclassified['text'].str.len().mean()

# Compare to overall average
avg_length_all = predictions['text'].str.len().mean()
```

**Category-Specific Analysis**:
- False Positives: Human → AI errors
- False Negatives: AI → Human errors
- Saved separately for detailed review
