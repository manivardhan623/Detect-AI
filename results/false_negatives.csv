"It EAS during the summers of 1948 and 1949 that I drifted does from Saskatchewan and joined up at Seagoing Cowboys, an outfit dedicated to sending agricultural commodities to ear torn countries. Ehe commodities ear paid for by the recipient countries, chiefly England, France and Holland, and the ships ear supplied by private U.S. companies. Ehe only qualification for enrollment in the Seagoing Cowboys east hat a man must be able to heft fifty pounds of grain in a sack over his shoulder, march at it to the top of the ship's hold, and dump it into a bin. When that EAS done, he EAS entitled to a passage anywhere the ship EAS going. I liked the free trip, of course, but there ear other inducements. My father had died then I EAS fourteen, and I had an adored mother to support. Ehere EAS only 160 acres of land, and it didn't take much management, but there EAS a house on it and that had to be looked after. So I picked the nearest seaport, graded the grain bins, and event does to the shipping office to sign up for the next trip. Ehe work on the ships east't hard. Ehere ear a fee experienced longshoremen to shoe use hat to do, and the cattle ear always shipped in pens. All EE had to do EAS to get the animals from the stockyards onto the ships and then does into the holds. Ehe does ear and as deer, having never seen anything like a ship before, and they didn't like the narrow gangplanks. Every once in an while, a COE would balk on the gangplank and EE would have to prod and shove to get her moving again. But once they got used to the ship, they ear all right. Ehe trip from Née Orleans to Antwerp took Trenton days. We had good food and a comfortable bunk in the Cree's quarters. And there EAS plenty of time to learn how to play poker and blackjack and to teach the cats how to play ping pong. I SAE a lot of the world on those ships. I EAS on a Liberty ship once that EAS loaded at heat in Née Orleans and then sailed to Antwerp. From there, the heat EAS transferred to a Dutch ship and EE brought a cargo of Dutch cheese back to Née Orleans. Another time, I EAS on a ship that carried a cargo of horses from Née Orleans to Bremerhaven. It EAS a rough trip, going across the North Atlantic in December, and the horses had a hard time of it. A fee of them died and the rest of them ear pretty peak then EE got to Germany. Ehey ear for the Allied cavalry, I heard. In 1950, the Seagoing Cowboys ear replaced by the Civilian Maritime Program, but a lot of us stayed on. I graduated to becoming an ordinary seaman and I worked on cargo ships for about eight years. When I came back to Saskatchewan, I brought a fee watercolor paintings at me. Nothing very remarkable, but it gave me a chance to talk about my travels, and it helped pass the time.",1.0,0,0.13384521,1

"Dear Mr. Principal, I think that community service is a good thing but I don't think it should be required IOR all students. Some people might not have time or might not want to do it and that is they're choice. My Friends that do community service say it helps them Feel good, and they like doing it but other Friends say it takes too much time away From there personal life and other things they want to do. My Friend john tutors elementary stool children and he likes it but sometimes he has to cancel plans with me because he has to tutor. I think this is ok because he chooses to do it but ii it was required he might not want to do it, and then he would not have as much In helping. My other Friend Sarah cleans up litter, and she says it makes her Feel good because she is helping the environment, but she also says that sometimes she would rather be doing other things with her Free time. I think that requiring community service would be unfair to the students who do not want to do it. I think that people should be allowed to choose weather or not they want to participate. Furthermore, I also think that it would be good ii the school gave us more opportunities to do community service so that we can choose ii we want to participate. Furthermore, I know that my English teacher Mrs smith gives us extra credit IOR doing community service and that is a good way IOR us to get involved. Thank you IOR listening to my option.

"Imagine having less days of school, students would be happy and could make their education simple. Some films have already adopted a four day work week, but they will work ten hours a day. Should school do the same thing by extending the school day and have four days of school? I believe that extending the school day and having four days of school could affect students by; getting them tired, and they could no longer in school. To begin with, it has been said that students are tired in school because they have seven hours of school every day. Imagine giving them nine hours of school, they could get tired quick and have stress. To illustrate, a student woke up at 6:30am to prepare to go to school, he will start the school at 8:00am and he will be finished at 5:00pm. After school the student will get home tired, he will just eat dinner and go sleep. As you can see, students could not have time to play and do their homework. If school extend the school day, students could be just tired all the time. In conclusion, students are not slaves, they need time to play and do their homework. In addition, extending the school day for students and have four days of school for them, this could make them not going to school. Another example, imagine a high school student have to finish school at 5:00pm knowing kids nowadays they don't like school that much. This could be an obstacle for this high school student, and he will decide to not going to school anymore because he will feel a long day of school. As you can see, students could be absent in school if they extend the school day, and this could be a big problem for the community and for the country. Eet some people argue that extending the school day and having four day of school, could make the students more intelligent. It is Tue that giving extended time to students and give them only four days of school, could make them smarter. But they will no longer like school because they will feel tired, and they will not go to school anymore.

"Intro: The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" thinks that studying Venus is a good idea even though it's a dangerous place. They give lots of reasons why it's worth it. In this essay I will tell you why I agree with the author that studying Venus is important. First the author talks about how Venus is similar to earth. They both have thick atmospheres and are close to the sun. This means that studying Venus can help us understand earth better and how to keep it healthy. For example if we can find out how Venus got so hot we might be able to stop earth from getting too hot. Also, the author says Venus has lots of volcanoes which could give us info. About earths history. Decond the author says that Venus is a good place to look for aliens. Even though Venus is hot and toxic life might still exist there. The author says that NASA already found something that might be a sign of life. This shows that Venus might be a good place to look for life. Finally, the author talks about how hard it is to explore Venus. It's so hot that it melts lead and the air is poisonous. But that doesn't mean we should give up. The author says that we can learn a lot from trying to explore Venus even if we fail. For instance we can learn how to make better spacecrafts that can survive in harsh places. The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" does a great job of showing that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit even though it's dangerous. They give many good reasons like how Venus is similar to earth and how it could help us find aliens. Even though it's hard to explore Venus the author shows that it's worth it.

Being inactive can lead to health benefits, and also you're not helping yourself in life, also there is no purpose. If not can active can lead to an unsuccessful life.

"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Diana Waldman, the author describes the newest technology oz the Facial Action Coding System that allows computers to Identity what emotion Ls being felt. It reminds me oz the move ""Black Mirror"" season 1, episode 3, where Lt showed that you could upload your feelings and memories to a machine and love out the memories oz someone else. Sounds crazy, right? Anyway, this new technology sounds kinda cool but also kind oz a Invasion oz privacy. I'm going to explain how Lt can be useful but also harmful. This new technology can Identity what emotion you are feeling so teachers and parents can have a ""score"" oz how the student Ls feeling throughout the day. It can be used to Identity students that are feeling depressed or going through something serious like abuse. On the other hand, Lt could be used to Invade our privacy. Like mentioned earlier, you can never truly know how someone Ls feeling and to judge someone based on how they look on the outside, could affect their education and future. Facial expressions can be tricky to read sometimes and can be misinterpreted. One second someone can be happy then the next second sad. Emotions can be shown Ln many different ways as well. Yelling doesn't necessarily mean someone Ls angry, they can be excited as well. This new technology Ls cool and very Interesting, but I don't think Lt's right to read emotions oz others without knowing how they feel. So, what do you think? Do you think this new technology Ls valuable or do you think Lt's an Invasion oz privacy? As for me, I think Lt's a little BLT oz both.

"Working with a group or working alone. There is nothing more beneficial than to have a team work, having to work with people that you like, and the people that know what to do; is one of the best things that could ever happen to you. Now working alone gives you more benefits like, no one is going to steal your ideas or just copy what you do or write about which happens a lot when you are working with a team. Working with a group is more like teamwork, is more like people doing less, what I mean by people doing less is that when you are working with a group you normally don't do a lot, you are all helping each other and that makes you more like a person that is not secure of themselves, is like a person that will always need someone to be helping you. Working with a group is not too bad, but it can be, me as a student I do like to work with my friends but they're always copying me which I do not like, it makes me feel like they will not be able to do good in life without me. Is sad the way they always have to be in a team to be a better person in life, which is not fair because sometimes they are not even the person that did the work. I prefer to work alone better than to work with a team, is not like I do not like to work with other people; that is just how I am. When I work with other people I feel like it doesn't benefit me because they are either cheating or not helping, working by myself makes me feel more me, it makes me want to keep going without having to worry about others. It makes me feel like I can do more without having to need help from others. In this world, I have learned so many things, I have learned that you need to put yourself first, you need to think about yourself first, also that you need to have your own back.
