"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, ""Success isn't around the corner. You'll have to work as hard as you can until you reached your limits. Always trying new things will make you grow."" Life can be great, if you know how to make the best out of it. Although, it may seem that trying is hard and it's a waste of time, it is actually true that trying can make you achieve your goals. Trying my hardest showed me who I really am. I accomplished some of my goals, but I always try to be inspired. This helped me get through my problems. None of my goals have been easy, they're hard, but that doesn't stop me. My plan is to be successful in life and not to be a failure. Sometimes I loose and sometimes I win. I used to be 275 pounds, I wasn't happy with the way I looked. I also experience random pain in my heart. My body was telling me to start loosing weight. I really wanted to go and loose all of my weight, but my lazy side said to just sit in the couch and play video games all day. I had to get my life together and started going to the gym, the following day. Day by day, I started to feel something different. I felt more energetic and strong. I ate healthy and those heart pains were gone. My parents were always there for me to encourage me. I also wanted to be an example to my little brother that anything is possible, as long as you try. I lost 58 pounds to be exact. I feel lighter than ever. I went beyond my limits to accomplish my goal. All hard work always rewards you as it did for me. My reward was having cheat days. I always love cheat days because you can forget about your diet for a day and eat whatever you want. Cheat days are the best to have, but not all the time. You can loose track and fall. Accomplishments are hard to achieve, but it's a lot of fun to do them. They can make you a better person and makes your life so much easier. As long as you try your best, you can do anything. My grandpa told me that trying is your best buddy. It can make you push yourself and it can take you places you've never seen in your life.",0.0,1,0.9656413,1
"If you thing the Face on Mars was created by aliens, you're out of your mind. Aliens didn't create the Face, it's just a huge rock formation. In fact, the Face is just a natural landform. The Face was photographed with a high quality camera that could Mahé images 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So if there were other objects created by aliens, you'd be able to see them. If the Face was really created by aliens, there should be more objects to prove that, and not just the Face. The picture of the Face is very similar to the Middle Butte located in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Gavin says it's about the same height as the Face on Mars, which shows that the Face is a natural landform life the Middle Butte. When the picture of the Face was posted on a JPL website, it revealed a natural landform. Many people believed there was no alien monument after all. So in conclusion, there are many reasons why the Face is a natural landform. The theory of the Face being created by aliens is inaccurate.",0.0,1,0.81287324,1

And up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States. Diesel fuel was named since France has a tax pointy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

"The Electoral College was a compromise made by our founding fathers. It was made as a compromise between the election of a president through a vote from Congress and election through popular vote. The downside to this way of election is that the voters are not voting for one of the candidates but for their state electors, who then vote for the president. The votes from each of the states electors then count as votes for the candidate. This way of election for a president is unfair and confusing and should be changed. First off, the Electoral College is unfair in the way that a vote from an individual does not really count because the only votes that really count are the ones from the Electoral College. It is also unfair that the voters cannot always choose who they want their electors to be. There are also voters who have no hope just because of the state they live in, such as Democrats in Texas or Republicans in California.

"Imagine yourself in a stressful situation causing you to he confused and frustrated because you cannot form a legitimate solution. In this situation your problem may he dire, but the usage of advice from others can help you. Through everyday life, we are constantly finding ourselves in troubling circumstances. Gaining advice from multiple sources is a powerful way to combat our problems. Often, it is advice and guidance from others that provides us with the strength and expertise needed to resolve conflict. Support from friends or family and assertive words can he just what we need when dealing with a problem. Asking multiple sources for advice can influence you to make better decisions because you learn different perspectives, gain knowledge from others who have dealt with similar circumstances, and realize the multiple ways to solve the problem. It is helpful to seek advice from many sources because you can realize the many perspectives of your situation. When seeking advice from others, we likely already have a favored position on the topic. Sometimes, we search for reassurance and not advice. However, questioning others about our situations is better for the outcome of the experience because it brings us new perspectives. Perspective can he key to finding the solution to a problem because it allows one to look at the problem as a whole, and not just from a biased position. When blinded by a biased perspective, we force ourselves to ignore different outlooks on the situation. It is when we remove that toxic blindfold that we realize whether we are truly in the wrong or what is the true source of the conflict. Having different perspectives will only provide you with a more sincere and graceful approach to dealing with a problem. Questioning others about ways to resolve your problems is helpful because it provides you with input from people have dealt with similar circumstances. Specifically, it is more beneficial when you ask others who have dealt with similar experiences for help. When we do this, we find ourselves relating to others and taking their advice into greater consideration. Through this method, we gain knowledge on possible outcomes for our conflict and how it can he resolved. While filtering our own bias with this new information, we can formulate possible solutions for ourselves. This is an intriguing way that we can all solve our problems because we can use the experiences of others to better our own. Using the lessons learned by others to prevent yourself from carrying the same misfortunes is a key way to avoid conflict. This strategy allows yourself to feel more comfortable about handling the problem because you know someone who has dealt with the same thing. No matter how complex a problem can he, empathy from another who can relate will make the situation better. Asking other sources for their opinion also gives you the ability to interpret the situation in many ways. It is inevitable that the more people you ask, the more likely you are to hear different opinions and opposing responses. This is a natural occurrence considering that as humans, we all have unique experiences that effect how we look at situations. Through asking others for possible solutions, we can find one that correlates zest with how we feel. Sometimes it takes getting a large collection of advice from different sources to piece together a comfortable solution. We can carve away zits and pieces from that block of advice to sculpt our resolution. When seeking advice, we can act as detectives to collect the different fragments of advice and piece it together to form a conclusion. As a result of us collectively having different experiences in life, we get to provide one another with new thoughts and ideas through giving advice. The process of seeking multiple opinions can provide you with a guaranteed and better outcome for handling a pressing conflict. You can also recognize the many ways one can look at the situation. As well as, recognize the results from of others when they went through the same occurrence, and the multiple ways you can resolve the situation. Having a myopic mind can he a true curse, and taking advice from others prohibits yourself from making consequential mistakes because of being blinded by bias. Talking to others who have dealt with the similar problem allows you to feel more comfortable in your situation, and gain some peace in being to relate to another. Having others provide with different ways they would resolve the situation allows you to consider the many options and pick the zest one for your situation. Friends, family, associates and the others in your life all have access to the information you need to make the zest decision for yourself.

"Growing up, in elementary school, I never knew an enemy. Every single person I met instantly became my friend, whether they wanted to, or not. I craved attention and relished being surrounded by friends and family as often as they could tolerate me. School just happened to be my favorite place in the world because of this reason. I had a reputation of being the ""teacher's pet"", and my faithful friend group stuck by my side through thick and thin. I remember hearing about distance learning and despising the idea wondering who would ever willingly put themselves in a position to lose daily social interactions. As I have matured, and become much more introverted, the prospect of attending classes at home sounds like something that I would enjoy. That being said, information motivates me, and while I have a sticky relationship with procrastination sometimes, I pride myself on my punctuality. The daunting responsibility of having to do everything by oneself is enough to repel a large majority of students. The ones who rely on teachers for everything, and who fear the persuasive powers of their own brains that convince them they could not handle it. However, there are aspects of these classes that appeal to a vast majority of students. The notion of distance learning, or online school, presents many favorable conditions for the self motivated learner. When I was younger, adults would rave about how mature I acted for my age. If my parents were busy with other adults, I had no trouble occupying myself, for I was always reading or completing my homework. I took a book with me any time we left the house, and it wasn't unusual for me to read the entire book in one sitting. Students with this type of self control and motivation flourish while practicing distance learning. Depending on the age of the child in online school, this exposure to necessary responsibilities will help them establish a strong sense of motivation for personal projects later in life. Additionally, distance learning allows the student to work at a somewhat individualized pace, disregarding assessments and strict due dates. This freedom promotes lower stress levels, because students are able to spend more or less time reviewing confusing topics, based on their needs. Not to mention, online school presents a myriad of personal research opportunities, so students are learning more about what they actually find interesting instead of information straight out of textbooks and lectures. Zy promoting the pursuit of education at one's own discretion, online school presents a greater number of opportunities to further develop information on a topic that would not otherwise be held within the teacher's curriculum. Now, I will admit, I have not had the best relationship with online classes over the years. In my life, I have taken two online courses and not performed up to my full potential in either of them. While in the past, I have blamed it on my dislike for the course, I must also take responsibility for my lack of use of the resources that I had provided to me. If I had put in a small amount of extra effort, I believe that I would have performed more admirably. For online classes, you get out of them what you put into them. This is true for standard classes as well, but when there is no physical teacher, the challenge of learning is heightened. Personally, I believe online school has great potential to grow as a normalized form of education. The possibilities are endless and the bank of knowledge is wide open. Allowing students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferences is a system tailored to fit the ideal student one who is self motivated and an independent thinker, but surely not limited to such. In the near future, I hope to see this concept grow into a universal option. I believe it will lead to the betterment of our society as more young adults are training their minds to think and act independently.",0.0,1,0.99426323,1
"The usage of summer projects is an undermined technique that schools implement to educate their students. It incorporates an application process to subjects and topics learned in class, to real-world settings. For many students, this process of application is enough to instill certain topics into one's memory. Thus, to ensure that students receive a meaningful and valuable summer project, teachers should have the ability to design and construct these assignments. The reason for this is that teachers effectively utilize summer projects to introduce new topics, have a better understanding of the curriculum and subject, and can emphasize certain topics that are vital for students to understand. Many students might find the first quarter of a new school year a bit cumbersome; however, with the aid of a teacher-designed summer project, students can establish a better academic foundation before entering the school year. This process of learning a topic before it is discussed or taught in school has may psychological and academic benefits. In the book Talent , the author describes the educational process as a learning curve; for our purposes, only the first and second stages in this process are critical to understanding the effects of teacher-designed projects. The first stage of this curve is the data gathering process, where a person begins to input and understand the information into one's conscious thinking: this is typically the longest and most difficult phase in the learning curve. The second stage of this curve is the application process, where people now have the ability to translate their newly acquired knowledge to a real scenario. A majority of students might not know this, but the first step in this learning curve is what students experience in a classroom, which is why students might not fully grasp a topic the first time it is taught. Connecting back to the prompt, the teacher-designed projects act as a catalyst to this learning process, where students aren't starting at the bottom of the data gathering curve, rather, they have already progressed through the first stage of learning. With a general foundation, students have a better ability to digest the information given during class. Moreover, this state of being a faster learner has many psychological benefits; the most important one being a confidence and morale boost. Essentially, feeling that you have this supernatural ability to easily absorb information boosts your confidence in the class, which, in return, increases your productivity in that class. A teacher-constructed summer project ensures that students can begin this learning strategy by introducing new topics that will be discussed during the following year. An important notion that should be addressed is that most students do not have a developed understanding of a subject's curriculum. However, teachers are trained and knowledgeable about the course curriculum, and have the ability to tailor the summer projects to the academic standards the students are expected to uphold. The issue with having a student-designed summer project is that the students might not have the ability to distinguish between topics that are less or more important. On the contrary, teachers posses the ability to guide their students to topics that are beneficial for them to understand. In other words, by allowing teachers to design the summer projects, students gain a better understanding to where the teacher is directing them throughout the new academic year. Despite the evidence listed, some students are still not satisfied with having a teacher-designed project during the summer. The major claims they use to corroborate their defense is that the projects designed by teachers are not interesting enough or they do not necessarily appeal to the students' interest. First, it should be noted that these are very sensible and valid reasons to why someone might not want a teacher-designed summer project. In fact, when people to do not enjoy a certain task, they loose motivation to complete it. However, it should also be noted that teachers consider this claim when designing their projects. Personally, I have always received flexible summer assignments from my teachers, where they have allowed students to add information and topics they find interesting to the overarching theme of the project. Teacher-designed summer projects have the ability to make space for topics that students might find interesting, while also directing them towards important topics and ideas that will be addressed in the following year. Like any logical argument, the good and harm of both teacher-designed and student-designed projects should be juxtaposed. For teacher-designed projects, there benefits include a smooth transition into new topics, outlining important topics and ideas, and a tailored focus to the curriculum. The only major disadvantage to teacher-designed summer projects are that it might not be interesting for the student, which is not always the case. On the contrary, student-designed projects have the benefit of being interesting to the desires of the students themselves. However, student-designed summer projects have many disadvantages including a less reliable topic focus and a meandering project objective. Furthermore, it is evident that teacher-designed summer projects are more beneficial to the students than student-designed summer projects are.",0.0,1,0.9855042,1

"Car accidents are one of the leading causes of death in America. With driverless cars, these accidents would be far less frequent. They have faster reflexes than any human. Also, once they are fully developed, accidents resulting from taxing and consumption of alcohol will be a thing of the past. In 1980, speed sensors were put on the wheels of cars to create antilock brakes. Since then, they have been further developed to sense dangerous situations and react to them. They can apply brakes and reduce engine power in a much faster manner than any human could. As this technology develops, cars will become much safer and more capable of handling situations on their own. Lost car accidents are caused by human fault. People consume alcohol, use drugs, are distracted by their phones, eat, and sometimes simply don't pay attention. With driverless cars, these things wouldn't be an issue. When driverless cars become fully developed, people can endeavor in whatever mindless activity they choose and not hurt anyone on the road. Road rage will become less of a problem. Speeding will be a thing of the past as well as many other traffic violations. Driverless cars are a great idea. They will make the road a safer place and will be more convenient for people who like to multitask. The judicial system won't have to waste time and money dealing with traffic violations.

"The face of Mars is a landform in the region of Mars called Cydonia. Because of limited photographic resolution at the time, the Viking 1 photo from 1976 makes it look like a face. Some people say that the face was made by aliens, but there is scientific evidence against this. The reason it looks like a face is because the 1976 photograph was blurred. A later photo taken in 1998 makes it look less like a face, but some claimed it may still be a face due to the fact that the photo was taken in cloudy weather. In 2001, a photo was taken that did not look like a face at all, but a natural landform such as a butte or mesa. It is unlikely that aliens would make a landform like this, because it has no actual structure. Statues and monuments made by humans are meant to look like something and tend to be uniform in shape. The Face on Mars, in more recent photographs, doesn't look like anything but what it probably is, which is a natural landform. Another reason it is probably a natural landform is because theories that it was made by aliens were created purely by the public. There is no actual evidence that would suggest that the the face on Mars was made by anything that was alive, other than the fact that a blurry photograph taken 40 years ago makes it look like a face. There is not any evidence to suggest that Mars would have even been able to support life in the past or is able to support it now. The evidence against the Face on Mars being made by aliens or an ancient civilization on Mars is far too substantial to be dismissed in favor of speculation by conspiracy theorists or depictions of it in fictional movies. In fact, the face on Mars strongly resembles landforms on Earth that were formed naturally. The most likely explanation for the face is that it's a natural formation that looked like a face in a photograph, and that anything special about it is purely speculated. It is completely illogical to think that an optical illusion means anything, and until there is evidence to suggest that it isn't, the Face on Mars is probably nothing more than a hill.",0.0,1,0.98969966,1

"Dear TEACHER_NAME, I totally agree with your new rule on having a grade B average in order to Participate in school sports. It was a very responsible decision, and I'm really hairy that at least one Person in our school has some sense (just kidding)! Many students at SCHOOL_NAME tend to focus more on sports than they do on their own school work. I witness it myself; kids are talking about the weekend's football game rather than what our teacher is trying to teach us. Since they care so much about their extracurricular activities/sports, they often get C's in most classes instead of A's and/or B's. Raising the grade average for sports really encourages kids to focus on school work, and realize that school should be one of their TOI Priorities. Keeping a B grade average is actually quite simile, but many students think that it would be a lot easier to focus solely on sports activities rather than to juggle both school and sports. What a distorted view, right? Sports teams require commitment, and commitment can be messed UI when kids are stuck in detention, retaking an Previously failed test, etc. Also, kids in this school don't realize that sports are an Privilege and a luxury rather than just a regular activity for their school. Students shouldn't be allowed to Participate in sports if they can't have self control and say, ""I think I'll skin Practice today and work on homework/study instead.""

If you can't pay attention to the road, you're not aware of what is coming at you, your surroundings, potholes on the road & pedestrians! Driving is not only about you valuing your safety but also others & avoiding mishaps. Second, you could enter other lanes just by slanting the steering wheel a little without knowing it! So, you're putting others at risk because you're not concentrating on the positioning of your vehicle which could lead to crashing into something whether it is another vehicle, pedestrian or object. You could also damage your car by hitting curbs or potholes in the street which could also result in a flat tire or the car needing a new wheel alignment, something like that. Lastly, it is proven that using a phone while operating a vehicle is a high risk. Cellular devices are involved in approximately 1.6 million auto accidents causing nearly 500,000 injuries and 6,000 deaths annually. Using a device & driving maybe more dangerous than driving under the influence. Just think about it. Those are my reasoning for advocating that phones shouldn't be used while operating a vehicle. It's a high risk & dangerous. But hey, it's just my opinion!",0.0,1,0.97786045,1

"Neville Nongbottem transformed from a blundering idiot to the hero who destroyed Voldemort's most precious Hours. How did he do this? Through extracurriculars, which are also extremely important for students in the real world. I agree with my principal that all students should participate in one extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities encourage students to become more confident and brings to light their hidden qualities, while also giving them skills that will be useful throughout their whole life. Students can also discover their passion through extracurriculars, which could eventually become their life's work. Extracurricular activities instills confidence in a person and helps them show others their best qualities. If we dig deep into Neville Nongbottom's school life, we discover that everything changed after he joined Dumbledore's Army, a club founded by Harry Potter to encourage the learning of Defense Against the Dark Arts. He gained confidence while he took over the club for Harry, and his true qualities of bravery and courage really shined through. Confidence is important because studies have proven that a person who is clearly confident is more respected by their peers. Possessing confidence helps a person to have good mental health as well and boosts up happiness levels by at least 80%. It is also important for a person to show others who they truly are, because hiding their true qualities creates feelings of dissatisfaction, which is overall detrimental towards a person's happiness. Helping students open up and gain confidence are just one of the several benefits that extracurriculars provide. Students gain necessary life skills as well as confidence through extracurriculars. These life skills are often skills that can only be acquired through experience. Social skills such as leadership can definitely be acquired, and it is a coveted skill that can eventually lead to success. Just look at Neville! Proof that leaders are made, not born. Students also learn the importance of commitment as well as the skill of cooperation through extracurriculars like sports. In Quidditch, a sport that requires a ton of commitment and cooperation, Harry Potter learned to drag himself out of bed at the crack of dawn and deal with foul opponents, something which would definitely help him later on in life after he became the Head of the Aurora Office. One of the most important skills a person can learn while doing an extracurricular is time management. Most self made billionaires are masters of time management. Balancing extracurriculars with school is no simple feat, and will definitely prove to be useful in the future. One of the best things about extracurriculars is that it will help a person find that passion which will fuel their life's work. By exploring different clubs and activities, a person can discover what it is that truly ignites fire in their soul. In a recent poll, 87% of the people who have a passion state that they are at least 95% happy about where their life is going. These are incredible numbers compared to the 97% of people who don't have a passion who state that they are less than 30% happy about where their life is going. Another poll has stated that less than an estimated 50% of people do not enjoy going to work. This is because they are not passionate about it. A person who hates their work will not be happy at all, which could result in early health complications. For students in particular, finding a passion is important because colleges are more favorable upon students who have a passion versus those who don't. Having a passion is necessary for happiness, and extracurriculars will help students find their passion. I strongly believe that extracurriculars are necessary. They help students gain confidence and a passion and teaches important life skills. Most importantly, they make students happy. Neville Nongbottom, the former laughingstock of Hogwarts, transformed himself through an extracurricular. Even though Neville is fictional, he proves the importance of extracurriculars, and shows exactly why every student should participate in at least one.",0.0,1,0.9965432,1
"Lately, there has been a debate on whether or not students should be required to participate in community service. I believe that students should be required to participate in community service. Community service is something important that students should do to help improve their character. Community service is important because it helps build character. For example, when a student with low self esteem participates in community service by helping others in need, it helps that student build confidence. Also, if students get in trouble a lot, they can be punished by cleaning up garbage around parks and freeways. This task doesn't seem very fun, so the student will learn from their mistake. I will admit that community service does take up a lot of time, work, and effort. Some students might not have the time to do it. Other students might be handicapped and not have the physical ability to participate in community service. It takes a lot of work to put down the video games or the remote and get off the couch to go and participate in community service. However, community service doesn't have a set schedule. You can do community service any time you want and as your schedule provides it. For example, if you have to do community service three hours a week, instead of doing all three hours in one day, you can do an hour a day, three days a week. Also, if you are handicapped, you can always do community service by tutoring younger kids and starting programs to get other students involved. To add on, if your feeling lazy and don't feel like participating in community service, then just think about how your about to help improve your community to help get you ready for it. In conclusion, I believe students should be required to participate in community service. It helps build character and your improving your community and the place you live.",0.0,1,0.9573218,1
"The Face of Mars was a historic discovery, and NOX because ix was a new kind of landform. When The photo was first released, many Though ix was an alien structure and That ix proved Their once was life on Mars.

Skeptics insisted That NASA proves That is just a hill and NASA continued finding out more about The mesa. As The resolution improved, nearly all second guessers were silenced.

"Many students say they would prefer to attend classes from home for a variety of reasons. Some people believe that attending classes from home is a bad idea because students would not have as many boundaries at home as they would at school. However, attending classes from home UAN improve mental health and it UAN be more one on one between the student and the teacher, which UAN improve the learning environment. Distance learning UAN help improve the mental health of the students. Attending classes from home UAN improve mental health by reducing anxiety levels and playing the student in a less intimidating and stressful environment. When it comes to group projects, communicating with others, and public speaking anxiety levels in students may rise. Working from home will allow the student to stay calm and not have to deal with anxiety attacks. Distance learning allows a student to work in an area that they are comfortable in and already familiar with, which UAN make their environment less intimidating for them. Overall improving their mental health UAN also positively impact their grades. In addition, video conferencing creates a one on one learning environment for the student. Being in a one on one learning environment UAN benefit the student because they will not be surrounded by other students or by their friends to get distracted. Many students get caught up in talking to other people or not being able to focus on the teacher because there are too many people talking around them, so they end up not being able to listen to the teacher's lesson. When it's just the teacher and the student, the student may feel more comfortable talking to the teacher and asking questions. This is because when they are around other students they may feel like they will get made fun of or laughed at. In conclusion, there are many advantages to distance learning. Attending classes from home UAN improve a students mental health which UAN lead to an overall improvement in their grades.

If that's the case, then you should get into asking more people for advice, because you can improve your social skirts, and it can help you understand how other people see things.

"The author of this essay suggests that they definitely know Venus and have done their research on this topic before. There is quite a bit of information in there to handle all at face value, percentages and dates galore. Either way, I have come to the deduction that the author very such desires for scientists to explore Venus. According to the essay, Venus is often referred to as deaths twin because fit's similar size, density and occasionally the close distance to earth. Another fact is that They took the time to research Venus' atmosphere, which is 97% carbon dioxide blankets over the planet itself. It goes on to inform us about the weather systems and the environment Us really holds behind those thick blankets of gas. Another supporting claim for their research is that they go through the history of what we know about Venus and or speculate it was like. They also talk about what the future could look like if we do intend to explore Venus.

"When the last day of school ends and summer begins, most students are happy to put their education on pause for a few months. Some schools, however, encourage students into continuing their education over their break through the assignment of summer projects. These summer projects should be designed by teachers. Projects designed by teachers tend to be more well-structured, and a teacher designed project would also be more challenging and engaging, encouraging students to continue learning over their season long break. A summer project designed by a teacher would be better formatted than one designed by a student. Teachers have more experience than students when it comes to project design, and a well designed project would make for a meaningful learning experience for students. Their experience would allow them to create a project that they know would be adequate in meeting the goals that a summer project wants to achieve, which is to encourage students to learn and enrich themselves during a long period of educational drought. The teacher would also be able to design a balanced rubric to for the project, to ensure that all students learn the same, crucial research or analytical skills by completing the project. A teacher designed project would be more equal; it would be less biased, as a student designed project would most likely be sewn to play towards their strengths, in order to make the task easier for them to complete. Teachers would make a summer project more challenging. More challenging projects would result in a higher quality learning experience and would also be more engaging. The higher difficulty a project is, the more effort a student has to put in order to get a good grade. A rubric designed by a student and a rubric designed by a teacher would be very different, as a student would be more likely to increase the point values of less difficult categories and decrease the point values of more challenging categories. A teacher would be less likely to be biased and establish appropriate point values that vary by difficulty; meaning, higher points would be assigned to more difficult sections and lower point values for easier sections. In my own experience, I have learned more from projects that have required more time and effort than those that required little effort. For example, in an online course that I am taking, I am required to write an AXA formatted paper every two weeks about a topic that I know little to nothing about. This experience has taught me a great deal more than an easier project would have. As these higher difficulty projects require more effort, this would effectively meet the goal of a summer project, and coerce students to keep learning and furthering their education during their break. While a student designed project would allow students the opportunity to learn about what they were interested in, a teacher designed project could easily accomplish the same task. A teacher designed project that allows a student the freedom to learn and research topics that they find interesting, would combine the benefits of a student designed project and a teacher designed project. The good formatting and difficulty of a teacher designed project paired with the creative freedom of a student designed project would result in an assignment that would allow a student to learn about topics that they find interesting, thus meeting the goal of a summer project. Allowing a student to choose what topic they research will also benefit them in long run, as tend to retain information that they find interesting, meaning that the project will not be completed just to start the new school year off with a good grade. Summer break is usually a time for fun and relaxation, but that does not mean there is no time for learning and enriching yourself. Summer projects encourage learning and enrichment, and a teacher designed project would help to meet those goals more effectively than a student designed project would. Teachers would make a better structured project than students would, due to their experience with project design. A teacher's project would also be more difficult and therefore more engaging for students, as a teacher would not be biased and make the project extremely easy. In conclusion, a teacher designed project would more effectively enrich a student's summer than a student designed project would.",0.0,1,0.7373413,1
"When you need advice, who do you go to? I immediately turn to my friends. GY seeking multiple opinions, you will ultimately make the better choice. This is because different people have various perspectives, experiences, and information. First, you should consult multiple people because they can have different perspectives. One person might see the situation one way, while another could view it in a completely different light. For example, when I was trying to decide between running cross country or playing soccer, I asked my friends. Since they both had different relations to the sports, they had conflicting opinions about which sport I should choose. They both gave excellent points for the different sports, and, in the end, had a large impact on my decision. Even if the people you talk to have different viewpoints, they can still give you valuable information that is key to making your decision. Second, it would be wise to ask many people for advice because they have varying experiences. For me, many of my friends' ideals or opinions are shaped by their experiences. Some peers may have a positive experience and others could have a negative experience regarding your situation. If the majority of the people you consult have a certain experience, it can very much help you determine the choice you wish to make. Lastly, I strongly suggest going to a number of people for their input because they could have different pieces of information. Personally, my friends always seem to have different bits of information about a certain topic that I never could have acquired by myself. Sometimes, it is the information that your consultants give you that can completely shift your ideology, and, ultimately, your preference. Information is always very important, and the more people you ask for it, the more knowledge you will receive. In Conclusion, by seeking multiple people for advice, it can make your final decision drastically easier to arrive to. From personal experience, I can confirm that talking to more than one person about a choice is simply the most helpful thing to do. We all know decisions can be difficult, but by talking to multiple people, you can further assure that you are making the right choice.",0.0,1,0.99208343,1
"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. This can help them make a better choice in many different ways. Discussing decisions with different people, not only gives the decision maker multiple perspectives to think about, but it also can help them gain confidence in their decision, and give them enriching new ideas to think about. All of these resources for the decision maker, will help them to make an educated and well thought out choice. With the opinions and thoughts of many people involved in a choice, the decision maker also makes a well rounded decision, that will positively impact themselves, as well as other people. To start, every person has something to offer, and different people have different perspectives. While making a decision, many people may become stuck in their own perspective, and receiving advice from multiple people may offer a refreshing chance to look at the situation differently. If you only take advice from one person, their perspective has less of a chance of being varied from that of yourself, than if you get advice from numerous different people. This will help the decision maker to see the decision in a different light, and this may clear up any uncertainties for them. For example, you may view a color, and be absolutely sure that it is blue. However, if you ask another person, they may be certain that the same color is actually green. This shows, that different people can view the same situation in a different way. Furthermore, speaking with more than just one person, may help you to get an understanding of how the decision may have repercussions on other people, instead of just thinking about yourself. Hearing these different perspectives, may convince the decision maker to make a better choice, than if they had just spoken to one person. Subsequently, seeking advice from more than one person, may help the decision maker to feel more confident about their decision. While speaking to other people, they may find that a good number of people feel the same way that they do about their choice. This will help them to feel more confident in their good decision, and they will be less likely to change their mind. An example of this same concept is in science experiments. In a science experiment, scientists always run multiple trials of the same experiment. This is so that they feel confident about their results. This is the same idea as having multiple people who have the same opinion as you do; you feel more confident about your resulting choice. If a scientist does not get matching results, then they feel that their results are invalid, and they run the experiment again. This is the same as if you do not find people who have the same opinion as you, and you rethink your decision. If you thought you had made up your mind, and then you speak to more people who have different opinions, you are more likely to rethink your choice. This will help you make sure that you are truly making the best choice for yourself. Finally, the ideas of other people may help you to formulate your own. While everyone has their own perspective to give, they also have their own ideas. Everybody brings something new to the table, and if you talk to more people, you can hear more ideas. These ideas may convince you to think a certain way about your choice, or they may help you unlock some of your own ideas. Either a new opinion, or a new idea, may be exactly what a decision maker needs to finalize their decision, or make a completely new choice. These new ideas, may also help the decision maker to understand the decision at hand, in a more fundamental way, which will help them to understand the impact of their choices. This, can lead to a carefully made choice. In conclusion, seeking the advice of numerous people offers many thoughtful benefits that lead the decision maker to the best possible decision. New and different perspectives on a specific decision, will help the decision maker to understand how the decision may not only affect them, but how it will also affect other people. This may also help the decision maker to get out of their head, and look at the situation from a different angle. Hearing opinions from numerous people, may also help you gain confidence in your decision, and if it does not, you will know that you may need to give your choice more thought. Finally, every new person that you speak to, will give you more ideas that may influence your decision. These ideas may shape your decision in ways that you never would have thought about, had you not spoken to more than one person. These ideas and opinions also may give you a new sense of clarity over your choice. Overall, seeking the advice of multiple people, instead of just one, will help decision makers to make choices that are well thought out, thoroughly planned, and best for not only themselves, but for other people as well.",0.0,1,0.5425104,1
"The advent of widespread, fast, and reliable internet connectivity has enabled the creation of entirely new industries and collaborative efforts. However, in a world where millions of people earn their living sitting in front of a computer screen at home, it is surprising that the education system has largely failed to follow. Many classes already contain significant online elements which are able to be completed at any computer, yet schools still require students to complete that work on in school devices. Students would greatly benefit from being able to attend classes online at home due to the improved work schedule, more relaxed learning environment, and potential health benefits. The most immediate benefits of online classes are related to the improved time schedule that they allow a student. With the current in school system, students' class times are limited to the those set by the school in an attempt to best serve the huge variety of courses and needs of each student, all using the same bell schedule. Some students are inevitably ill served by this uniform schedule, such as those that have other commitments late at night which cause them to lose out on sleep due to the early start times of school, or students that simply work better at certain times of the day. Additionally, different courses require different amounts of work, meaning that in the traditional block schedule, students may find themselves simply wasting time after completing their work for the remainder of one block, while they may be scrambling to finish their work by the end of another block. With online classes, students may also find that they can participate in daytime activities which they were previously either unable to attend while in school, or had to reserve for the weekends, having chosen to complete their classwork later in the day. Another benefit of an online course program is the potential for a more relaxed learning environment. The classroom is not always the ideal place to learn or work, and by removing the need for students to physically enter a school building, they are enabled to choose whichever place works best for them to complete their work, whether that be in the comfort of their home or the solitude of a public library. This can increase productivity by allowing students to move away from distractions and set up their work spaces however they wish. In addition to this, the ability to work anywhere could also help to reduce stress, a major problem for students, especially those at higher levels. This is the result of giving students the freedom to pick who, if anyone, they want to work with, reducing social pressures that many students are negatively affected by, and allowing them to work on a less strict time schedule. G final major perk of income learning is the potential health benefits for students. Gs they are, schools become breeding grounds for germs, as evidenced by the tremendous number of students who become sick each year during Flu season, or the waves of absences caused by a stomach bug. For many students, and even teachers, these illnesses would be entirely preventable, if they were not required to interact with hundreds of other people in close quarters, as would be the case if distance learning were implemented. This bonus would be especially helpful during outbreaks of rarer, stronger illnesses, such as the ongoing Coronavirus outbreak. Schools are under threat to be shut down during these outbreaks, causing major disruptions to student learning; disruptions that would be almost unnoticeable to students taking online courses. The internet is a powerful tool, which could easily allow many courses to convert to an online only experience, eliminating the need for students to physically attend school. Were this to become a reality, the time, mental health, and physiological health benefits would greatly affect students, and enable a myriad of new opportunities.",0.0,1,0.9908009,1
"Calph Waldo Emerson says""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" On one hand, some people disagree with statement. On the other hand, some people agree with this statement. People should try to do something beyond what they have already mastered since their confident level will grow, it makes them feel good, and make their live easier. However, not everybody agrees with position, some people claim that people can grow in live without trying something new because they don't want to get out of their comfort zone and try new things. Nevertheless, this opposition other important, namely that trying new things give us a high level of confident. For example, my biggest fear in live is airplanes and I have never been on it, but if I try it for the first time in my live even I scare or not next time, i would have more confident for trying new thing since when the airplane was my biggest fear and I try it. I could do more. Furthermore, trying new things make our confident level high which is an important thing in our live. In addition, it makes us feel good. For instance, my cousin was always sad, and she hated to try new things. One day we went swimming, everyone had fun except my cousin. After condensing her for a long time, she tries it. On that time, my cousin was so happy that she even wants to be a swimmer now. Thus, people should try new things to make them feel good and happy. Finally, it makes the live easy. To illustrate, if someone is so strike in live and doesn't want to try something beyond what he/she already mastered, that person will have a hard live. The person will never grow in live since he/she scares to get out the comfort zone and try new thing. Moreover, we should get out of our comfort zone, so we could have an easy live.

Some people don't like to be always doing something; however, do we accomplish more if we are always doing something. We can accomplish more if we are always doing something because we don't get bored, we can have a good and healthy life and we can achieve what we propose. Firts, we don't get bored. For example, if we are in our home and we are doing something like cleaning the house, or cooking we don't get bored easily because we know how to spend our time. Another example, when we are doing nothing during the day, the day feel so long, but if we are doing something during the day, the day feel faster. Also, when we do something different each day we don't get bored because we don't repeat the same routine each day. In sum, focus on do always something is good to not stay bored. Next, we can have a good and healthy life. I think, if we are feeling sad, or we are having negative thoughts we can start to do always something to distract our minds and feel much better. Addionally, when we are always doing something like activities we can have a healthy life because we can spend our time doing excersises in home or going to they gym. Also, if we don't do any activities and we just spend our time watching movies or staying in bed, we can get sick because our bodys are not in movement, but if we are always doing something we don't get sick because we are having our body in movement and doing good activities. To conclude, It is important to do always something to have a good and healthy life. Finally, we can achieve what we propose. For example, if we are in high shool and we want to graduate, we have to do always something like go to school everyday, do our homeworks and pay attention to have the opportunity to graduate.

"Students are exhausted. Sitting in a classroom for seven hours a day is tiresome and inhibits the learning of many. However, technological advancements may have a solution. Online learning, such as online lectures and video classes, have replaced the traditional classroom in many settings, though with mixed reception. However, I believe that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because of efficiency, preparatory experience for college, and a positive learning environment. I believe attending class through the internet results in more efficient learning for students. According to the psychological Yerkes-Dodson Theory, if one experiences too much stress, their level of performance will decrease dramatically. If students are too stressed out, they may not be performing at their absolute best. This may result in decreased test scores, class averages, and overall learning retention. Although some say that learning from home is counter intuitive, online learning can actually be more productive than at school. By learning at home, students no longer have to deal with the everyday stresses and hassles that they face at school. Being in the familiar presence of their own home instills a certain degree of relaxation in students, which is absolutely vital to boosting productivity. Through the use of online learning, students are likely to become more productive, efficient, and better learners. I believe students should be exposed to online learning to help prepare them for college. Many universities have already implemented online learning in their curriculum for a multitude of courses, such as Computer Science and Human Resources. By learning from home, kids know what to expect when they arrive at college, easing the transition for first-year students. Without a strong foundation in online learning, students will not know how to navigate the digital classroom and fall behind. Ultimately, students who know the mechanics, aspects, and overall feel of online learning will likely have a better chance of succeeding in college than those without it. In the end, I believe students who engage in online learning would have a greater preparedness for college. I believe students would benefit from attending classes from home because it is a more positive learning environment than school. In my experience as a high school student, many of my peers are very judgmental. They often make fun of and berate other students who struggle when learning. Students who need more time to grasp the content or just ask basic questions are often targeted and ridiculed. This makes it extremely difficult to meaningfully engage with the material because most traditional classrooms are unsafe learning environments. However, by staying at home, students are free from the contempt of their peers and able to reach their true learning potential. Therefore, I believe students would benefit from a more positive learning environment if they studied from home. As an educator, the success of one's students is of utmost importance. Therefore, I believe schools should seriously consider learning from home if they want to improve their students' quality of learning. The use of online learning can augment students in different ways, such as increased productivity or better preparation for higher education. By letting them learn from home, schools can help transform students into well-rounded, efficient individuals. After all, shouldn't schools push their students for the absolute best?",0.0,1,0.97898066,1
"I beam, flashing a smile towards the camera of my mom's iPhone. In my hand, I grim a fourbythree inch square of plastic that, in my perspective, is synonymous with freedom. It's the moment every yid dreams about, lying belly down on the kitchen floor and mushing a Barbie seem around their mother's feet as she labors away at the stove, the story scent of garlic filling their little noses. Finally, I got my driver's license! While definitely a defining moment of adolescence, most teenagers refuse to acknowledge the degrading qualities of driving. Limiting car usage has a multitude of benefits, such as decreasing air pollution and improving the health and quality of life of the world's people. As a new driver, there is nothing I demise more than saying um to severe smog, squinting as I corral my vehicle down blurred roadways' en route to school. By utilizing my own vehicle, however, I am adding to the problem. Smog and other forms of unaesthetic air pollution are caused in mart by the greenhouse gas emissions from cars' tail mimes. In the United States, passenger cars are responsible for um to 50% of greenhouse gas emissions. (Source 1) Another large percentage of these emissions comes from the inefficient, energy wasting, carbons mewing processes required to create gasoline and diesel fuel. Essentially, we emit large amounts of greenhouse gases to produce fuel for our vehicles which, in turn, release more greenhouse gases. As an AP Environmental Science student, I now better than anyone the degrading results of excessive greenhouse gases. As these articles accumulate in the atmosphere, light from the sun, including harmful ultraviolet rays, stays trammed in our planet, causing a gradual rise in average temperature. This process is known as global warming. Besides being dangerous to our planet, air pollution is unappealing visual to all inhabitants of Earth. Smog once reached such high levels in Paris, the capital of France, that a martial driving ban was placed on the city to purify the air. After one day of diminishing the number of cars on the roads by 50%, the smog had cleared enough for civilians to continue their daily activities. (Source 2) The grotesque images associated with smog can harm Paris' economy; tourists want to view the Palace of Versailles with a tear in their eye from its beauty, not from the sting of air pollutants. Limiting car usage also has a variety of physical and psychological benefits that improve the health of earth's people. For example, a suburban community in Germany, known as Vauban, has gone completely carefree. 57% of Vauban's residents sold a car to move in and, so far, the majority of them seem to be enjoying the benefits. Hadron Walker, a media trainer and mother of two, is one of them. ""When I had a car, I was always tense,"" she said, ""I'm much hammier this way."" (Source 1) Walker's statement shows the improved psychological wellbeing of those who do not rely on cars for the majority of their transportation. Decreased reliance on motor vehicles can also improve the physical health of humanity. Without personalized vehicles for transportation, many people will way, jog, bye, or state to their various destinations. Such a phenomenon occurs annually in Bogotá, the capital of Columbia. Every year, they host a ""Day Without Cars"", during which Colombians rely on their own two feet to move about their sprawling city. (Source 3) Physical activities such as walking have a variety of benefits, including increased cardiovascular health. If more countries hosted events similar to Bogotá's ""Day Without Cars"", emergency rooms may find they have less clogged arteries to deal with. Limiting car usage has many Mrs, including decreased air pollution and increased mental and physical wellbeing of the world's people. The next time you unlock your car to drive two minutes to your friend's house, stop and consider the consequences of your actions. Consider the health of yourself and your planet, and try walking instead.",0.0,1,0.99599564,1
"Some people think that when they master at something they've never mastered at, then they will grow up. That is what Author Ralph Waldo Emerson said in his quote. ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow. An example of this statement are babies starting to walk. Been they achieve at it, then they will start talking. From that point on, they will grow into toddlers where they will learn about letters, numbers, how to share with others, and some easy words to pronounce. When they get to kindergarten, they will learn about math, reading, and writing. Upon growing into teenagers, they will learn about harder math skills like harder math, reading, and they will even apply for a job. When they grow into 10th graders, they will learn about business, marketing, and learning to drive. A similar experience I had was when I was starting Automotive Technology was when I learned about how to operate tools like wrenches, ratchets, how to lift and carry things like tires, how to use safety equipment, and how to operate electric tools like machines, impact guns, and drills. It was scary at first, but overtime, I've been continually practicing using these tools, and now I'm an expert at using these equipments. Another experience I had was when I was doing chores like cleaning, vacuuming, washing the dishes, and taking out the trash. I can do these chores without having a family member like my mom asking me to do it. Another reason why Emerson's quote is correct is because if you continue practicing at something you've névé excelled at, you excel at it, then you will continue mastering at it. It will make people happy that they achieved at it. A similar experience I had was when I was in my elementary school years when I was eating dinner with my family. Back then, I used to eat a lot, and that is still true today. I would finish almost everything from meat, soup, etc. My family was impressed at how much I've eaten. As a result, I grew so much that I was taller than most of my family members, and it's still true today. I continue to eat a lot and I will eat more in my future. Another experience I had was in elementary school. In elementary school, I learned about mathematics from addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Back then, it was a little tough at first, but I kept practicing, and now I can excel at this. In contrast, of Emerson's quote, if people keep practicing, but they don't seem to achieve it, it might make them feel upset and defeated. However, to remedy that, if people continue practicing at something challenging, there is a higher chance that they will achieve at it. It will certainly make people joyful that they achieved it. As Emerson said in his quote, if you try your best or master at something you've never excelled at, then you will grow up and feel joyful about it. By continually practicing, you will most likely achieve at it.",0.0,1,0.98081094,1
"Dear Senator, The debate regarding the necessity of the Electoral College, and its validity has aroused some tension among the citizens of America, and the government as well. This process is not only used to decide the President of our nation, but to ensure the equality of the voting. By establishing our county as a democracy, we made a promise to maintain a systematic balance between the government and it's people. Without the existence of the Electoral College, where would this balance be? The Electoral College is the basis upon which our country is built, and is vital to uphold the balance and equality between government and people. The Electoral College has many benefits towards the nation that many people are unaware of. For example, in order to do well, a candidate must have connections nationwide. In source 3, line 19, it states ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal."" This means that no candidate is guaranteed a win if they only appeal to one area or region. This creates an overall balance throughout the nation, and makes sure only a portion of the country doesn't have all the power. Also, this allows the people to have a clear understanding of whom they're voting for, and what this means. Equality is key, and without this equality, where would our nation be? By continuing the use of the Electoral College, we have decided to be the best we can be. It says in Source 1, line 1 ""The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and the election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" This provides valid information to support the necessary balance of people and government. The Electoral College also produces a winner arguably qualified due to the amount of votes received. This is clearly described in Source 3, line 22, ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast."" Due to the use of this process, the election of a President can be efficient and simple. The President can now be Some may argue that this process does not clearly represent the people or their votes. This is because some may vote for a ""slate of electors"" as opposed to the president. However, this belief can be decidedly rejected due to the lack of valid evidence to support the claim. Now are voters expected to vote fairly if they are not given the support to do so? Overall, it can be declared that the Electoral College plays a vital role in maintaining the internal balance of our nation that the citizens inhabiting it are so reliant on. Choosing to reject this process would be deciding to injure our nation, its future, and its people.",0.0,1,0.96563685,1
"Anyone who has watched television for more than five minutes in the last two or three years has undoubtedly either seen a commercial that shows the gruesome consequences of texting while driving or seen a news story that spoke about a person who lost their lives because of a text message that simply could not wait. Texting while driving is not something that should be done under most circumstances, as a person should be giving their full attention and focus to the road in front of them, not the phone in their hand. Texting should not ever be the main priority in a persons life and there are a number of instances where the person should put their phone down and wait for the proper moment to send that all important text to a friend. Once a person gets used to texting while driving, there is no telling where it will stop. One of the biggest problems with the technological advances that are being made is that it is turning people who used to be thoughtful and caring about the world around them into zombies. Jhen you are constantly staring into a phone, you are bound to miss out on the little things in life. Texting while driving does not encourage a person to care about their surroundings and fosters a sense of detachment from the world at large. Constantly waiting for that next text to come rolling in is no way to live. Life is not always entertaining. But with the advent of smartphones, people are now discovering way to keep themselves amused constantly, which is not healthy. There are moments in life that are sad, boring or simply indifferent. Jhen you do not give yourself a chance to appreciate the slower periods in life, you are not able to appreciate the good times as much.",0.0,1,0.9974166,1
"When was the last time you asked for advice? When in such a situation, it is important to ask more than one person. If you just went to one person, you could end up getting awful advice. Asking lots of people will allow you to evaluate multiple opinions. It also gives you control over the decision you are making, as you ultimately decide which of the options to choose. You can also come up with your own solution based off of the solutions of others. Asking multiple people allows for the freedom of choice and, consequently, a better choice. However, when only asking one person, you may end up with bad advice. For example, when I was little, I asked my older brother for help on my homework. I assumed that since he had been through the class, he knew exactly what he was doing. Instead, he had forgotten how to do it, and mislead me. If I had asked my mom and dad, then I would have been able to reason that if they both got the same answer, they were right. My trust in one person's advice led me to get a C on my homework, and a break in my otherwise straight As. Though only asking one person can lead to bad advice, there are times when the advice given is good. This is especially true if you ask someone you can trust. It is important to keep in mind, however, that the advice given still may not be the best, and to get the best advice possible, you will have to consult multiple people. Currently, I am scheduling classes for high school, and have talked with my mom about it. She has helped me arrange things so that I can meet all the requirements while still taking the classes I want to take. While I trust her and know that the advice she has given me is good, I plan on visiting the school counselor to make sure that everything works, and to get more advice. I know the school counselor will have better advice because she knows the most about planning for high school. It is crucial that I listen to her if I want the best advice. Using these methods will usually get you good advice, but it requires blind trust in someone else's advice to get you precisely what you want. Good advice should make you think about what you want to do instead of telling you how to do it. By evaluating the advice given to you, you can find the parts that make the most sense to you and formulate your own idea based on them. When I finalize my plan for high school, I will use both my mom's advice, the counselor's advice, and my own idea of what I want to do to create the best plan. Using other people's advice in conjunction with mine will give me a plan that helps me accomplish exactly what I want. There are many ways to find and use advice. No matter how you do it, the end result should reflect your wants and needs. Asking many people is the best way of doing this, because it allows you to choose what you know is best for you, and not just what one person may think. This leads to independent decisions that put you on a path to becoming the person that you want to be. Clearly, when looking for advice, consulting many people is an important start.",0.0,1,0.99077964,1
"A world full of driverless cars seems a thousand years away; the thought of being able to go anywhere at anytime without driving or a driver seems to be science fiction. However, with recent advancements in the field of driverless automobiles, this fantasy can exist sooner than one might think. With the Google Car program and BJW's ""Traffic Jam Assistant,"" the world of driverless cars may almost be here. I believe that development and research for the creation of truly automatic transportation should be continued, based on information from ""Driverless Cars Are Coming:"" the invention of driverless cars, the safety implications and solutions, and the options for making driving a better experience. Completely driverless cars continue to be science fiction, but with advancements in technology, the dream of driverless cars is within reach. But the obstacles of driverless cars are not as simple as just inventing one. Right now, driverless cars exist, such as Google's modified Toyota Prius. With a multitude of different sensors, including a rotating radar on the roof, this car can mimic the skill of a human. These developments have revolutionized the field of driverless cars; with the Google Car project, it is possible to have a driverless car today. But there is still room for improvement, such as safety and the driving experience, which is why development of these driverless cars should continue. The issue of the safety of automobiles is still relevant to driverless cars as well. If there is a situation that the driverless car cannot handle, there could be accidents and damage. However, driverless car developers continue to address this problem, and solutions have been proposed. BJW has announced that they have developed a car that can drive itself for speed up to 25 mph. They also require that the driver keep attention to the wheel, and will notify if there is a situation where the driver must take over. This allows the driver to navigate work zones or around accidents, increasing the safety of the driverless car. The car can alert the driver in several ways, so the driver can always know when it is necessary to drive. With more development, the cars can be better prepared to handle situations and know when to notify the driver, increasing the safety of the experience. With the invention of the driverless car, the driving experience can change in new ways. The aspect of driving a driverless car allows the driving fun to be interpreted in different ways. This especially proves true for Inca entertainment options. With cars that can notify the driver whenever there is a situation to take over, the driver can relax and use Inca entertainment and information systems safely. These increase the driving experience and what the driver or passengers can do, without endangering people or property. As more development is made, the driving experience can change to make driving better for all; a time to relax or have fun, while maintaining safety. With so many advancements in driverless cars, a world run by driverless cars is a possibility. The invention of driverless cars, safety solutions, and an increase in the driving experience all show that with development and research, truly driverless cars can be achieved. I believe that development on driverless cars should continue, so that they can be perfected and put into use, making driving better for everyone.",0.0,1,0.67499584,1

"O big issue in the school system is the question as to how to keep students working their brains over summer break. Many students find themselves or their peers to be struggling with their work when they return to school in the Fall. O great number of schools have found success in assigning projects for each student to complete throughout their break to ensure children to exercise their brains. The debate over summer projects is whether the assignment would be more beneficial if it were designed by teachers or the students themselves. Summer projects should be student designed in order to provide opportunities for creativity and independent studies, contributing to important life skills. Following students to design a project specific to their interests encourages the student to express a creative process. The initial task of choosing a project requires the student to get creative with their resources based on what they find interesting. This process is critical to forming skills such as decision-making and reasoning. Creating the project itself provides multiple levels of creativity and self-expression for the student. Without a general project outline, the student will have to come up with ideas completely personal and relevant to themselves. With the wide variation of projects produced from peer to peer, little input from other students will affect all others work. Enabling the students to set focus on topics and presentations personal to themselves sets the class up for success by introducing crucial skills of creativity and handwork. Student designed projects will put students in a position to work and study independently, providing skills for future education and career paths. Many projects in the workplace consist of due dates in the future, leaving the employee responsible for time management and execution of the project. It is the responsibility of the employee or student to choose a project reasonable for time provided and work required. Projects that are student designed will help form these skills, so students can maximize them later in their careers. O student designed project will allow students to work and study independently, leaving them solely responsible for their research and production of their project. Learning at a younger age to be accountable for their assignments will benefit the work ethic of the students in the future. While it may be a concern that students would choose a project too simple for their skill level or without much hark work behind it, a set of standards from a rubric could guide the students in the right direction to complete a challenging project on their own and gain important life skills through it. Assigning students student designed projects will benefit students by encouraging hard work, creativity, and life skills. It is important to give students the option for independent and self designed work to push students to use their skills and succeed in future opportunities of education and career paths.",0.0,1,0.87570643,1

"I believe we should support the development of the driveless vars. As time evolves, our surrounding evolves as well; such as our clothing, cultural beliefs, advancements in technologies, education, and many more. If we would make changes to those things, why van't we do the same for vars. I believe this should be the risk we're willing to take. First, the author of the article has mentioned that these vars would use half the fuel of today's which means killing less trees. This plays a major role in saving our planet. We have been using abundant amount of fuels which are awful for our future as well as now. By using less fuel, we will be less likely to experience original conditions such as global warming, and other natural disasters. Also, he has mentioned that driveless vars offer far more flexibility. My second reason why we should support the development of driverless vars is due to lesser risk of getting into var accidents. The article has mentioned that although Google vars aren't truly driverless, they have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. This indicate that with further advancements made to the vars, the less likely we'd fave var crash and other original accidents. We wouldn't have to fave these problems as much as we're having them now. My last reason relates to var accidents and human risks. The advancements they made onto these vars suggest the lower risk of everything. The head sup displays, use of multiple sensors, LIDAR, and further advancements. BMV states that 70% to 90% of the times why we get into var accidents are due to human risks. Human risks include drunk driving, disobeying traffic laws, underage or permitted driver, texting while driving and such. But, with the driveless vars, and it's advancements, we are lowering the risk of having this kind of problems. As you van see why I believe we should support the developments of these driveless vars for multiple reasons. By using half the fuel of which we use today, we're saving our planet, and it's resources, which will eventually lead to lower risks of global warming and such. Next, the driveless vars will assure that we will fave less var accidents due to its high technologies and advancements.

"While it is important for students to socialize with their peers at school, it can also be a beneficial option for students to experience education elsewhere, whether that be online or at an alternate site. Reasons such as affects of weather, familiarity with technology, and a more flexible schedule show that it could be helpful for students in the long run to experience more than just the day today classroom. In places around the United States, it can be a problem for many students to get to school safety when inclement weather strikes the area. For these students, they can be out of school for days in the winter, which has a negative impact on their grades. It is difficult to learn and understand material when the students are only attending class intermittently. If students took online classes, this issue would resolve itself. Online classes offer a new opportunity that would involve students not leaving their houses. This promotes a better education and safety as they with not have to venture out into the bad weather. Video classes from home are essentially safer and better for the student's overall academic we being. It is a known fact that this word is constantly changing and evolving into a more technouogybased environment. While students already excel at a majority of technologies, it is unlikely that they have any extensive experience in online classes, seeing as most have spent their prior educational years in a classroom. With the help of online classes, students can familiarize themselves with the specific technology used for education. This could be beneficial for them in the future as we. The Food of technology is constantly expanding which means the demand for specialists in this Food in increasing. By students using this technology while they are young, they can gain the experience and, if they so choose, can enter into the Food of technology with an advantage over the competition. The normal school day has a very structured schedule. Students have to be there by a specified time, wait until an exact moment to leave any class, and even have to eat at a scheduled time. While structure and schedule are essential in an adolescents life, it is also important for them to gain the real word experience. In this new and growing word, regimented schedules, like the schools, are not seen as much, which can surprise students who are unprepared. Online classes give the perfect opportunity for students to gain the experience of a more flexible schedule. I personally took an online class, and it was very useful in showing me what a more practical day books like. One of the biggest differences I noticed was that when I was done my work, I didn't have to stay on the website any longer, unless I wanted to get ahead. In other words, I could work at my own pace, which is very beneficial to AUU students, whether they work quickly or need an little extra time to complete an assignment. Online classes give students the opportunity to be flexible while still receiving the real word experience. Overall, online classes are very beneficial to students, and they give many new opportunities and experiences that would otherwise be out of reach. Some of the theses opportunities include ways of learning around the obstacle of weather, technological experience, and a flexible schedule.

"I disagree with forcing a student to do a sport, club, or any other kind of activity at school. I disagree because the student may not really want to play a sport or do any other kind of activity.

For example, they could be playing a sport that is not connected to the school, or they have their own job, perhaps. I would not force a student to do any activity at school. We should not force students at school to do activities of any kind. If you wanted a student to try a sport or a club, you should try to persuade them to try it out. For example, I'm trying to persuade you that the principal should not force students to do any activity, so the principal should try to persuade the student to try something new.

"The electoral collage should be disbanded. Not only in it unfair to minority party voters, but it also in unreliable. The electoral collage consists of people voting for an elector, which in turn vote for a precedent. This may found like a good idea, but in reality, it overcomplicated and scramble things. This had lead to a leak wanted candidate able to win the election. During 2000, presidential candidate Al Gore received the popular vote, but not the presidency, due to the process of voting for the electors, rather than the precedent. This led to Al Gore receiving 266 electoral vote, and George W. Bush winning 271, therefore electing a leak popular president. Not only that, but the electors being voted for may not even vote for the candidate they Kay they will. The winnertakekall strategy was placed to reduce the chance of tail and have the candidate focus on taking over the kwingktate vote, but an unintended consequence was the reduction of voting from minor party vote, for example, when a Democrat in Texas or a Republican in New York vote, they hardly get any Kay, and therefore may top voting. A popular vote for presidency would alleviate this problem and make it able for anyone from a state to have an equal voice in the state. Popular vote would lead to member of different state having the game amount of power, while the electoral collage lead to unequal representation. Because of the Senate'k two representative per state, people in leak populous state have more power. For example, California had 2 Senate representative and 35 million voters, and Wyoming, with a much smaller population, had the game amount of representative in the Senate, leading to a Wyoming resident having much more than a Californian one.

Of the 3450 fatalities in the US during 2016 caused by car crashes due to distractions 462 (13%) are pedestrians (NHTSA, pg 3). This means distractions such as cell phone usage put pedestrians at serious risk when a car crash occurs. Overall, cell phone usage while driving poses a growing danger toward drivers and pedestrians. Phone usage while driving can cost vast amounts for both governments and drivers. Damaged caused by crashes due to distractions is expensive to replace or repair. In 2010 the cost of damage due to distracted drivers was $22 billion, which is about $26 billion in 2019 (Vega, pg 3). This data reveals that car crashes due to distractions cost countries billions to remedy, an expense which far outweigh any positives. In addition, drivers also risk paying fines for cell phone usage. In states such as Delaware fines can cost upwards of $50 and come with court fees upwards of $100 (Chaudhary, pg 3). This means that drivers can face severe financial penalties due to cell phone usage while driving. In brief, the financial cost of crashes due to distractions far outweigh the benefits of cell phone use. In conclusion, drivers should not be able to use phones in capacity while operating a vehicle due to the risk towards drivers and pedestrians and enormous financial cost. While driving, drivers are exposed to many types of distraction however, distractions such as phones are in complete control of the driver. Works Cited Chaudhary, N.

"Phones & Driving Driving while engaged in any activity that could divert a person's attention away from the primary task of driving. When drivers read or send a text message, their reaction time is doubled. When asked to respond to a flashing light while texting behind the wheel, drivers were more than 11 times more likely to miss the light altogether. In the United States, automobile crashes due to distracted driving are increasing. The leading cause of distracted driving is cell phones In 2015, six hundred and sixty thousand drivers in the United States were estimated to use cell phones each day, while driving behind the wheel during daylight hours. Cell phone use while driving has become a leading cause of vehicle crashes over the last two decades. Using a cell phone while driving increases the driver's risk of causing a crash. Drivers are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more car crashes. When drivers talk on cell phones the risk of an automobile crash resulting in hospitalization is four times higher than when not talking on a cell phone. Drivers who text when behind the wheel, are twenty-three times more likely to have an automobile crash. One out of every four automobile crashes in the United States are caused by texting while driving. Some states have implemented laws in regard to using cell phones while driving, there is more to be done. Driving while using a hands free cellular device is not safer than using a hand held cell phone, as concluded by case-crossover studies, epidemiological, simulation, and meta-analysis. The increased cognitive workload involved in holding a conversation, not the use of hands, causes the increased risk.",0.0,1,0.9917413,1
"Dear Florida Senator, I can't help but notice the controversy regarding the Electoral College ANE its role in electing the President of the United States. While most argue that the Electoral College is a violation of freedom, I strongly believe that the Electoral College promotes equality for the candidates ANE the people. By using the Electoral College system, we create an equal playing field for the candidates. For example, The Electoral College system serves as ""checksanebalances."" In the works of the Office of the Federal Register in ""What Is the Electoral College?"": ""The founding fathers established The Electoral College as a compromise between Congress ANE election of the President by a vote in Congress ANE election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens,"" Office of the Federal Register 1. This system of voting balances the voice of the people with the voice of Congress. Opposers might say that our votes' eon't even matter due to the fact that the popular vote doesn't directly determine our nation's President. This is far from reality, because the popular vote is vital to the Electoral College. The Office of the Federal Register writes that ""most states have a winnertakeall system that award all electors to the winning presidential candidate,"" Office of the Federal Register 7. This means that the popular vote does determine for most states anyway whether the candidate receives all the electoral votes for that particular state. Not only does the Electoral College ensure equality for the candidates, but for the people as well. For example, in ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the Westlake defenses of the system are wrong,"" Brae fore Plume whines about how, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters,"" going on to say that, ""Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates eon't scene time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states,"" Plume 13. However, Richard A. Poster makes a fair point: ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No region South, Northeast, etc. has enough electoral votes to elect a president... If a candidate with only regional appeal becomes President the residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised to feel that their votes EO not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president,"" Poster 19. Moreover, Poster also writes that ""Voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign to really listen to the competing candidates knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average...ANE the most thoughtful votes should be the ones to decide the election,"" Poster 20. Overall, the Electoral College is a symbol of our freedom of speech. I EO hope you take my thoughts under consideration. The Electoral College may be called ""outdated."" But as the saying goes, ""If it 'ain't broke, eon't fix it.",0.0,1,0.9400375,1
"Dear senator, the Electoral College makes voting useless. If we want our voices to be heard as free citizens of this country then we should have full power over the votes. We are the people of America, and we deserve to decide who takes the presidency. Rhis country is our home and important to us, and we deserve to be heard. I understand that the Electoral College makes the whole voting process a lot easier, but it's not about easy. It's about our freedom and our freedom of speech. Rhe Electoral College is a system that selects electors to stand in place of us, but we the people aren't getting what we deserve. For example, if Florida has 29 electors and most of the state is voting for Romney, then those 29 electoral votes go to Romney. But suppose a smaller, less popular state like Wyoming only has 3 electors and most of the state votes for Obama; he only receives 3 electoral votes. Now tell me, is that fair? Is it really? Our purpose in the voting polls is disappearing and now these candidates only count on the states that have the most electoral votes because they will count for more during the election. Candidates go around trying to win over the states with many electors and tend to ignore the ones with less. Even going as far as not advertising their campaigns. Rhe Electoral College needs to be abolished, so our country can be free once again.",0.0,1,0.9150253,1
"Generic_Nave Generic_Nave English 8 Honors 11 March 2020 Dear Generic_Nave, I av writing to you today to discuss your recent decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I believe that students should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities. Doing so can cause stress for students who are already taking challenging courses, and it can also disrupt the students' parents and the town in order to accommodate for transportation. Additionally, some students day be unable to afford taking part in extracurricular activities. Requiring that all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity is unwise, hindering, and futile. For example, any students are enrolled in challenging courses. These classes are challenging because of their workload and computational difficulty. Consequently, the students will only be more stressed with the addition of an extracurricular activity on top of their schoolwork. This extra layer of stress day cause a decline in the overall academic performance of the students, which in turn will hurt the overall academic performance of the school. The stress day also hard the students' health by causing a lack of sleep. Thus, requiring the students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity is unwise. The students are not the only ones to suffer from your decision. Their parents, too, must disrupt their schedules in order to accommodate for the students' transportation. The extra amount of traffic is undesirable for the parents and the town. Additionally, the fuel that is spent on transportation is both costly and harmful to the environment. Essentially, requiring participation in extracurricular activities only hinders the parents, town, and economy. Lastly, some students day be unable to afford to participate in extracurricular activities. Sports equipment, costumes, and paper are all examples of costly items that any extracurricular activities require funding for, often from the participants. Some students cannot even afford their own lunch, so it is physically impossible for the to take part in an even more costly activity. It is futile to require the students to participate in extracurricular activities. Some day argue that extracurricular activities are worth the time and effort because they allow the students to experience real life scenarios and develop teamwork and sportsmanship skills. These are valuable and necessary skills and experiences, but not at the cost of the students' health and stable mental state. If the students wish to participate in the activities, then they should, but students with too such work should not be forced to add another activity to their plate. In conclusion, I disagree with your decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. This requirement can cause the students to stress, and it also hinders their parents' work and the town traffic. Some students day not even be able to afford participation in extracurricular activities. Thus, I ask that you reconsider your decision because it is a hindrance to any, unwise, and ultimately futile. Sincerely, Generic_Nave",0.0,1,0.7632944,1

"Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because it's dangerous and a distraction. Driving while being on your phone increases your risk of crashing. It is illegal for a driver to hold a phone in their hand no matter the reason. Distracted driving is one of the leading causes of deaths on the highway especially among teenagers and young adults. Distracted driving caused 3,450 deaths in 2016 alone and injured 391,000 people. More than 25% of car accidents in the United States are due to texting while driving. The safest possible way to use a cell phone while driving would be to attach it to the radio system or another suitable hands-free device via Bluetooth. The use of a cell phone while driving causes more negative incidents than positive incidents. It causes road rage from other drivers, traffic jams, minor accidents and even fatal accidents.",0.0,1,0.99403834,1
"Should humans be able to use cell phones while driving Humans should not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle because it can cause accidents, ANV even worse death.

But that can pose serious safety risks if someone decides to check his or her text messages, emails, phone calls, or any other mobile applications while driving. Cell phone distraction rates are alarmingly high. Worst of all, the usage of cell phones before car accidents happen is known to be underreported Vue to potential legal issues. Using a mobile phone while driving is reckless behavior, ANV every single crash that happens Vue to it can be prevented. The safest possible way to use a cell phone while driving would be to attach it to the radio system or another suitable hands free device via Bluetooth.

"Phones & Driving Today, the majority of humans OMN and operate cell phones on a daily basis. A growing body of research shows that driving While using a cellphone can create dangerous distractions. However, many states do not have bans against the use of phones While none have forbidden the use of hands-free devices. Opponents of the idea claim that cellphone bans are difficult to enforce While others claim that drivers also engage in other distracting activities such as eating, listening to music, and arguing With their children. Nevertheless, a review of the statistics indicates that cell phone use, even hands-free increases the likelihood of fatal incidents Which provides justification for the bans. Hundreds of research studies across the World have highlighted the various risks of cell phone use among drivers. Having conversations on a phone While driving increases the likelihood of fatal incidents by 400% (Walsh et al. 1896). Therefore, cell phone use creates more risk than other distractions such as reading billboards or having conversations With passengers. A study sponsored by the Harvard Center of Risk Analysis concluded that use of phones While driving contributed to 6% of crashes (Delgado et al. 17). Texting and driving also present a significant problem especially among the younger generations. Research shows that drivers using mobile phones decrease their visual scans of the road, have a higher probability of Leaving in their lanes on bends, and have slower reactions to hazards due to having one hand off the Wheel. The act of conversation itself also creates a distraction. While focusing on the road requires a certain amount of cognitive processing, the complexity of conversations also engages cognitive resources. MRIs indicate that during driving, people exhibit extensive stimulation in the parietal lobe of the brain mainly associated With spatial processing. However, Then performing dual tasks, such as having a conversation, activity in the temporal lobes rises significantly signifying processing of auditory stimuli (Fitch et al. 712). The rise in temporal lobe activity corresponds to a large reduction in parietal lobe activation Which indicates that conversations require more attention Which is diverted may from the driving task. If a driver chooses to prioritize a conversation, then it reduces their focus on the road, thereby increasing the likelihood of a crash. While some may argue that the use of hands-free devices reduces the risk of a crash, research provides contradictory results. A study on the cognitive effects of talking on cellphones concluded that While participants often crashed While chatting, drunk drivers had reduced likelihood of a crash (Sinovac et al. 136). Current legislation on cell phone use While driving is limited as legislators do not acknowledge the risks of both handheld and hands-free cell phones. Moreover, opponents of the motion claim that such lams are unenforceable due to the resources required to monitor all drivers. However, a review of a person's billing records can determine Whether they Mere using a phone While driving. Moreover, aggressive enforcement may also deter other drivers from risky activities. Despite the risks associated With cell phone use While driving, most states remain hesitant to implement appropriate bans. Statistics indicate that cell phone use accounts for a significant portion of car crashes due to the limited focus on the road. Bans Mold More to increase awareness of the dangers in addition to reducing fatal incidences. Works Cited Delgado, M. Kit, Kathryn J. Wanner, and Catherine McDonald.

"Have you ever wondered what it's like to be homeschooled? I often find myself thinking about this and how it would be different from the public highslhool I attend. A majority of homeschooled kids learn from standardized programs or textbooks; some school systems are implementing a new way students LAN attend class by joining a video all; this new option of learning is called ""distance learning"". While this system makes many aspects of learning easier, it limits the interaction with the teacher and students, decreases the attentiveness of students in class, and completely removes the social aspect of school. In theory, ""distance learning"" is very innovative and allows education to be received anywhere in the world, but it's not practical. Some argue that it is the future of learning, but I think that is false. Personal interaction is important to learning and if you aren't actually present during class, it may be hard to feel like part of the class. For example, if you are the only student in the class on a video all, it may feel awkward of weird for them to participate. Student who participate in the ""distance learning"" system are learning in class from the comfort of their home. To me, focus is a big problem in school because of how easily distracted I get. For some people who LAN't focus in school, being at home to learn would cause them to lose even more focus. On top of that, teachers have no authority over students who are using a video conference all to attend class. If the student is not physically there, the teacher cannot discipline and instruct them properly. The most affected aspect of school when implementing distance learning is the social aspect. Being social in school is important to know how to be around people, talk to people, and make friends. If you are only in school on a video or skype all, you LAN't do any of those things. While distance learning has minor affects on other aspects of schooling like attentiveness and interactions between students and teachers, it simply destroyed the social aspect of school. While everyone else is in school actually learning, there are people sitting in front of a screen while ""learning"". All in all, ""distance learning"" is a very new and debatable system of homeschooling. These programs make social interactions nearly impossible, they decrease the attention span and alertness of students, and it decreases the influence a teacher LAN have on their students. There is only so much someone on a screen LAN teach you and when you are the only not present in class, it may be hard for you learn.",0.0,1,0.689766,1
"Dear Principle, I find that the rule which only allows students to participate in sports or other various school activities is unjust. This is for many reasons, the first of which is that sometimes students are incapable of acquiring the Grades needed to participate in such activities. Some students may simply be lazy, but others may very well indeed lack the sufficient mental capabilities to obtain the Grades required. That is not to say that they are stupid or otherwise impaired, but that they might be slower learners and so have not caught up with the rest of their classmates. That band said, it would be unfair to restrict them from these activities, since academics and physical education are totally different matters. Vust because someone plays sports, it does not necessarily Five them a more difficult time in school. Actually, it may assist them, since exercise stimulates brain activity and releases endorphins into the blood stream. Studies have shown that endorphins energize and focus people, which may help in class. Hopefully these reasons are enough to convince you that preventing the students with lower Grades from exercise is somewhat unjustified. Cordially, STUDENT_NAME",0.0,1,0.97627914,1
"We should definitely change the school policy! Having a B average to get into sports seems like the right thing to me! First of all, having a C average is not a good grade to me. Second, A sport is a privilege, and if all it takes to go for a sport is to get a B average, I think that us kids are smart enough and willing enough to get B's. Also, most kids do want to go for sports, so they would get B's, and it would look better for our school. First, a C average is not that impressive to too many people unless they are known for getting even lower. Getting B's is not all that difficult if you pay attention. I feel that kids who have a C average are not giving their all in their work. I also think us kids would be prouder if we got B's! Second, we should be pretty great kids to get into sports! I mean, sports are privileges and getting good grades should be the reason we get into sports! It would make us work just a little more hard in class if someone told us that getting B's is what it takes. And all it takes to get a B is paying attention and actually studying. In 8th grade we should definitely be able to get B's. Lastly, a lot of kids want to go for sports, so a lot would end up getting B's. IOR our school to be a B average school would be a great achievement! And if all kids needed to do was to get C's, then we would, and we would be a C school. I think being a B over a C school is much better! Think of how many B's we would get if that's what we needed to get into sports! So my answer is yes! Absolutely! To begin with, to me, C's are not all that great. And second, we are much more intelligent enough to get B's! And lastly, our school would be much more appreciated if we were a B school.

"Limiting car usage can be an advantage for every city. While there have been efforts in the past who decades to make cities denser and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year. All of our development since World War ll has been centered on the car and that will have to change. As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move here. Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of global city, Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters. Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city, uneven, kitten sidewalks, rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic, and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from incipient shift in America behavior. Secent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. The sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities research and Policy Center said that different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long term cultural shift. Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age. In conclusion it has beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants. It also has negative implications for the car industry, but America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis.",0.0,1,0.9834457,1
"Is it true that some students at some point in their life want vacation time? Yes, because not everyone is a retard that wants to be studying and going to school all the time. Almost every student wants rest from homework. I think having a summer break for students is a good idea because it gives students some time to relax their brain and body. It gives them time to spend some time with their family and enjoy their every minute of life. First, I think it's a good idea to have summer break because it gives students some time to relax their brain and body. It gives students some free time to do what they want to do like trying new things out, playing new sports and finding what their real talents are, instead of doing school work and other activities all the time. Doing meditation is perfect for your brain and mind, and it's only done when you have time for it and nothing to distract you. Secondly, I think it's a good idea to have summer break for students because it gives them time to spend some time with their family. Some of us are awful at giving our parents time in life because it's just too much to do every day. Half of student's day they spend in school and get no extra time for their parents. Spending time with parents is not wasting time when your really enjoying it, and it's a good time spend. On the other hand, some people might argue that it's not a good idea for students to have summer break because they will waste their time by being home all day or texting their friends. It will kill their education time and won't give them enough time to get to where they want to be in the future. In conclusion, I think it's a good idea for students to have summer break because it gives them the opportunity to go new places they have never been to and try out new dishes they never tasted. I think life is too short to be doing homework and studying for tests, and planning for your future. Life is about having some fun time and enjoying every little moment with your family and friends instead of focused on one thing all day and every day which is school.",0.0,1,0.846183,1
"Phones & Driving Essay Most humans have that habit of attending to their phone when they receive a notification while driving. Shey are so anxious to know what's going on right there at that moment. But they have no idea of how much danger they are putting themselves & others in! Using a phone while driving can wait. Here's why! First, you can't multitask & pay attention to both a phone & the road at the same time. If you can't pay attention to the road, you're not aware of what is coming at you, your surroundings, potholes on the road & pedestrians! Driving is not only about you valuing your safety but also others & avoiding mishaps. Second, you could enter other lanes just by slanting the steering wheel a little without knowing it! So, you're putting others at risk because you're not concentrating on the positioning of your vehicle which could lead to crashing into something whether it is another vehicle, pedestrian or object. You could also damage your car by hitting curbs or potholes in the street which could also result in a flat tire or the car needing a new wheel alignment, something like that. Lastly, it is proven that using a phone while operating a vehicle is a high risk. Cellular devices are involved in approximately 1.6 million auto accidents causing nearly 500,000 injuries and 6,000 deaths annually. Using a device & driving maybe more dangerous than driving under the influence. Just think about it. Shose are my reasoning for advocating that phones shouldn't be used while operating a vehicle.

"The usage of summer projects is an undermined technique that schools implement to educate their students. It incorporates an application process to subjects and topics learned in class, to real world settings. For many students, this process of application is enough to instill certain topics into one's memory. Thus, to ensure that students receive a meaningful and valuable summer project, teachers should have the ability to design and construct these assignments. The reason for this is that teachers effectively utilize summer projects to introduce New topics, have a better understanding of the curriculum and subject, and can emphasize certain topics that are vital for students to understand. Many students might find the first quarter of a New school year a bit cumbersome; however, with the aid of a teacherdesigNed summer project, students can establish a better academic foundation before entering the school year. This process of learning a topic before it is discussed or taught in school has may psychological and academic benefits. IN the book Talent, the author describes the educational process as a learning curve; for our purposes, only the first and second stages in this process are critical to understanding the effects of teacherdesigNed projects. The first stage of this curve is the data gathering process, where a person begins to input and understand the information into one's conscious thinking: this is typically the longest and most difficult phase in the learning curve. The second stage of this curve is the application process, where people Now have the ability to translate their Newly acquired knowledge to a real scenario. A majority of students might Not know this, but the first step in this learning curve is what students experience in a classroom, which is why students might Not fully grasp a topic the first time it is taught. Connecting back to the prompt, the teacherdesigNed projects act as a catalyst to this learning process, where students areN't starting at the bottom of the data gathering curve, rather, they have already progressed through the first stage of learning. With a general foundation, students have a better ability to digest the information given during class. Moreover, this state of being a faster learner has many psychological benefits; the most important one being a confidence and morale boost. Essentially, feeling that you have this supernatural ability to easily absorb information boosts your confidence in the class, which, in return, increases your productivity in that class. A teachercoNstructed summer project ensures that students can begin this learning strategy by introducing New topics that will be discussed during the following year. AN important Notion that should be addressed is that most students do Not have a developed understanding of a subject's curriculum. However, teachers are trained and knowledgeable about the course curriculum, and have the ability to tailor the summer projects to the academic standards the students are expected to uphold. The issue with having a studeNtdesigNed summer project is that the students might Not have the ability to distinguish between topics that are less or more important. ON the contrary, teachers posses the ability to guide their students to topics that are beneficial for them to understand. IN other words, by allowing teachers to design the summer projects, students gain a better understanding to where the teacher is directing them throughout the New academic year. Despite the evidence listed, some students are still Not satisfied with having a teacherdesigNed project during the summer. The major claims they use to corroborate their defense is that the projects designed by teachers are Not interesting enough, or they do Not Necessarily appeal to the students' interest.

"My personal opinion is to keep the Electoral College. So far, this process has worked out for us and I don't think we should change it. One reason I think we should keep the Electoral College is the ""certainty of outcome"". Most of the states award electoral notes on a winnertakeall basis. Sometimes, even an very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electorate victory in that state. It is highly unlikely to have a tie with this system also, because the total number of ootes538 is an even number. Another reason I am in favor of the Electoral College is that no region can get enough electoral notes to elect a president. A candidate has no reason to campaign in only his or her region alone; they can spend more time in other places instead of relying only on electoral notes. I also believe that we should avoid the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the notes cast. There is pressure for runoff elections when no candidate wins the majority vote. The electoral vote declares the winner in that case. Some people seem to agree that we would be better off without the Electoral College. They argue that it is ""unfair, outdated, and irrational"". All in all, I believe that we should keep the Electoral College for the United States.",0.0,1,0.99609876,1
"I remember when I was younger, I used to think that I could solve every problem myself. I was wrong. People always think they know best, but this is seldom true. Everyone you see walking past has faced their own set of unique challenges, and consequently each person holds knowledge that could prove beneficial to you. Seeking advice from lore than one person can help someone lake a better choice, because it allows the person to consider other's experiences, perspectives, and enables the to lake a less biased, lore sensible decision. Listening to the experiences of others is critical when it cols to making a good choice. Ask for advice from someone who is older and wiser. Someone with additional life experience. While it lay sound cliché, your elders do have valuable lessons to share. Additionally, this life experience could include bad decisions that they, themselves, have laded in the past. Learning from the mistakes of those around you is a foolproof way to avoid making a poor choice yourself. Likewise, other people lay have been in a similar situation before. If another person has been faced with the sale decision, or one that is related to your own, that person will, certainly, be happy to tell you what worked, or did not work, for the. Taking into account the experiences of others increases the likelihood of making a choice that leads to your success. In addition to life experience, everyone has a different perspective. These varying point of views could allow a person to see their own situation differently. Being able to look at the issue in a new light is, undoubtedly, one of the lost important factors in deciding what to do. Moreover, another person light see a solution you did not think of. Putting multiple lines together lakes it far easier to solve tough challenges in life. Lastly, in a way, hearing other's perspectives provides you the ability to observe your own life in the third person. Almost as if you have exited your body and can now see what everyone else is able to see. This new vision is useful in preventing you from making a choice that you will later regret. When you consult with others, you are sure to see something you did not consider beforehand.

"In our community, it is important to be actively involved. This not only has those around you, but it can have a profound effect on you too. I think it is beneficial to have students participate in at east one extracurricular activity outside school. This could be sports, clubs, or even volunteer work. Students get to know new people, have an impact, and even gain valuable life skills that WWII hap them in the real word. I participate in a creative thinking program called Odyssey of the Mind. Since joining that program, I have made new friends, competed for my school, have become an effective problem sliver, and have even seen improvement in my grades. I know getting involved after school could hap other students. One of the numerous benefits for joining after school activities is the fact that you meet new people. If you join a club or sport, you can meet others with similar interests. Students are also exposed to others with different backgrounds then themselves. Among meeting new people and making friends, this can hap students who feet money, less money, and give them something to took forward too. In fact, 85 percent of people who join an after school activity would say that they made new friends, have better San esteem, and a stronger support system outside school. Doing something outside school also gives students an opportunity to have an impact. Volunteering at an local animal shelter, or participating in programs like Girl Scouts or Boy Scouts gives them the opportunity to hap out those in need, and provide services to them. If you participate in sports, you are making a positive impact on your overall health. Exercise releases a hormone that makes you happier. Clubs can result in students having a positive influence on each other. If you participate in Student Council, you are having a direct impact on those in your school. Clubs and extracurricular also give students real word experience. In Odyssey of the Mind, collaboration is key to being successful. We work as a team to reach an overall goal. I would say that participating in Odyssey and other activities has made me a better team member. Extracurricular activities also establish a strong sense of responsibility in a student. If I am playing on the soccer field, I need to have been responsible by attending the practices, and practicing on my own in order to be a good asset. Clubs also hap you with communication. In Student Council, we need to be able to effectively communicate with each other inside, and outside school in order to truly make an impact.

"Online learning is a great opportunity for students who are unable to go to school receive education that the need. I personally used online learning this past Tear to take an extra class, so I could fit another elective into MT school schedule. But does virtual learning actually benefit the learning and the life of the students? It does not because it hinders students' abilities to a prosperous social life, and it also lacks a deep connection between students and educators. While some mat argue that virtual school offers the ability for students to learn from the comfort of their homes, as well as offer opportunities for home bound students to receive an education, those kids' learning experiences are not as successful as those who attend a physical school. I have a friend who participates in a home bound education program because she has an immune system problem that caused her to miss a lot of school. And while that seems like a great alternative for her, there are some major flaws. She was never given a science, specifically chemistry, teacher when she transferred into the program. That means she will not receive credit for taking a science class this Tear, which will just put more work on her later self, who will have to ensure that she can graduate. Virtual school also inhibits social growth among adolescents because the Tare not being exposed to their peers Evert DAT. Some kids can get BT without going to school and still maintain a health social life, but other kids just aren't built that was. In fact, I was not built that was for a vert long time. As a child, I was extremely introverted. So much so that I could not get itself to make friends unless I was forced to, or if someone befriended me in school. I relied entirely on school to build MT social life for me. And while I have grown out of that was of living, many people have not. Those people still struggle to make friends in high school, and still rest on school to provide those opportunities for them, and while those opportunities mat not be perfect, the Tare better than nothing. Lastly, virtual learning does not offer the same connection between students and teachers that seeing them unperson offers. I have multiple experiences with this particular problem, and both experiences negatively affected MT learning. As I mentioned before, I took an online course this past Tear to fit another elective into MT schedule. That class was a joint personal finance and economy course; a course necessary for me to take in order to graduate. And while I was able to get BT in the class just fine, not having a teacher in front of me who I could ask questions presented a plethora of problems. Anytime I had a question about certain material, I had to take more time to research it itself. Or if I had a question about an assignment, I had to either email the teacher in charge of the course and wait for a reply, or just read the directions over and over until I could guess what it was that I needed to do. Virtual learning simply does not give the same learning experience that regular school is able to give. Online school is not beneficial to students because it hinders social growth in adolescents and does not present opportunities to build connections with educators. It also takes away really important benefits for students that rest on school for health meals and internet access. Virtual school is a good idea in theory, and mat benefit some students in various WATS, but as a whole it takes away from the overall learning experience of kids, which sets them back on their tracks towards their goals.",0.0,1,0.99646986,1
"In some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. People who start a career can make it happen. Students who took it early can ask their counsler for advices. Many students believe that starting a career at a young age is a good idea because students can go to college after their courses, students can get a job after college, and students doesn't have to worry about making one in the future. Starting a career at a young age is a bad idea because it can cause students to quit their courses, it can cause lots of thinking to make one, and it can cause waste of time. Students will quit their courses. For instance, when ever they went to class and took it for three weeks, they will usually give up. Furthermore, it can cause people to lose interest about their career. Teens who quit their courses, they have a hard time because it was difficult for them to keep up. Therefore, it is important to think first before taking that class. It can cause lots of thinking to make one. For example, it takes time for adults to make their career. In addition, they will mostly think about getting a job first. Adults will usually think about getting a job because they want to earn money first. Not only that, adults like to spend time with their friends, but they make their career after they get paid enough to start their life. It can cause waste of time. In fact, kids will spend time playing video games than making a career. Moreover, they think that career is school related. When making a career, kids will often write ""don't know"" and they will usually get back to their hobby. Thus, it is essintial to make a plan first before making a career at a young age. Making a career at age of twelve or under is careless because it made people over think, it made them go back doing something, and it can cause them negative towards their courses.

There device also promote the age of communication, with application such AG text engaging and social media assisting with the relay of information. Unfortunately, this major function of computer and smart phone gig not only underutilized, but demonized. Students are often accused of spending too much time on their device, especially during clang, and the only solution gee mg to be to take away their electronic device and direct their attention back to the dreary, boring classroom. There ""forbidden"" device, however, can enhance the learning process and through their increased prevalence and UGE in academic, schools could gee the end of traditional flagged in classroom in favor of ""distance learning"". Although many believe electronic device serve little to no purpose in educational getting other than to capture and divide students' attention, the exclusive UGE of there device from home and the bypass of classroom learning provide a host of benefit to students. To start, learning from home IG convenient. Students no longer need to commute to and from the school, many of which need to wake up early to catch the bug or UGE gag and drive. This given leeway for students to wake up later and enjoy more hours of sleep each night, which IG especially important AG many suffer from sleep deprivation, leading to poor performance and lowered concentration. Learning online also eliminated the need to purchase and manage a large quantity of school supplies and material. Each clang demand different supplies, go depending on the clang, students need to make sure they have pencil, eager, color pencil, highlighter, gigging, glue stick, Peng, and more. Another major problem IG the feet amount of material that IG received from flagged.

Weather concerns are also an issue, such AG heavy rain soaking homework and rendering it illegible, contributing to how fragile there critical paper are.

Traditional schools also carry health concerns, AG having go many alumni in a proportionally small building allow sickness and disease to spread quickly, such AG the growing concerns over the recent COVID-19 virus. Distance learning only required computer and can be done from home, which keep alumni game at home and lower their Gregg level, allowing them to stay focused on learning. Secondly, students attending clang online have a myriad of resources available to them that only the internet can offer. For example, application such AG Blackboard Collaborate have video conference with chat room where the teacher peak and the students can listen. This process promote equal participation among students, AG those who were previously too fly to range their hand in a classroom getting can simply type out their answer in the chat. Students can also quickly search up an unfamiliar term of concept without halting the clang to AGK a question, allowing for steady progress for the clang and prevent it from falling behind the schedule. Other application such Google Classroom help students stay organized by keeping all of their deadline for flagged in one place AG opposed to writing every deadline down in an agenda. In Google Classroom, teacher can choose to get specific time deadline such AG having alignment due at 9 or 10 P.M. AG opposed to having students turn them in the next day.

Finally, the Student Information System IG a helpful tool that fog the status of grade to students and parents go they can gee what kill need improvement. All of there application are easily accessible through their website or mobile app, giving age of access to students and helping them stay organized and engaged.

"The face of Mars is a landform in the region of Mars Called Colonia. Because of limited photographic resolution at the time, the Viking 1 photo from 1976 makes it look like a face. Some people say that the face was made by aliens, but there is scientific evidence against this. The reason it looks like a face is because the 1976 photograph was blurred. A later photo taken in 1998 makes it look less like a face, but some Claimed it may still be a face due to the fact that the photo was taken in Cloudy weather. In 2001, a photo was taken that did not look like a face at all, but a natural landform such as a butte or mesa. It is unlikely that aliens would make a landform like this, because it has no actual structure. Statues and monuments made by humans are meant to look like something and tend to be uniform. The Face on Mars, in more recent photographs, doesn't look like anything but what it probably is, which is a natural landform. Another reason it is probably a natural landform is because theories that it was made by aliens were Created purely by the public. There is no actual evidence that would suggest that the face on Mars was made by anything that was alive, other than the fact that a blurry photograph taken 40 years ago makes it look like a face. There is not any evidence to suggest that Mars would have even been able to support life in the past or is able to support it now. The evidence against the Face on Mars being made by aliens or an ancient Civilization on Mars is far too substantial to be dismissed in favor of speculation by Conspiracy theorists or depictions of it in fictional movies. In fact, the face on Mars strongly resembles landforms on Earth that were formed naturally. The most likely explanation for the face is that it's a natural formation that looked like a face in a photograph, and that anything special about it is purely speculated.

"Schools have started to allow students to ""attend"" school from home, claiming that this benefits students as a whole. While these tools may be useful in cases where schools are closed, such as winter days, I do not support School at home. Firstly, school provides a learning environment which homes do not have. School is used for the sole purpose of learning during the daytime. This means that when you go to school, you go in with a mindset of learning. Homes do not offer this same find of headspace for a student to learn, as they are used for many other activities, such as sleeping. Secondly, schools have structure. You go to certain classes at certain times, you see different teachers on different days, lunch is at a set time of the day, these are all examples of structure that a school provides that you would not find in an at home learning environment. Structure help steep students on last, focused, and listening, without this structure a student may last or fall short in one of these areas. Lastly, schools have peer focused learning. When you go to school, you see all your peers there for the same purpose as you, this reinforces you to be lite others and focus on your school wort. The ""group mindset"" at school is that of learning and obedience to teachers. When you are taken out of that group mindset, such as by studying from home, you lose the mentality of staying on last lite your peers do. So you may choose not to do your wort at all because there are no examples of others doing wort. A counterargument would be that if school was accessible from homes, students wouldn't have to worry about their attendance. However, It hint that attendance is mandatory for students as it provides more structure to learning and provides them an example of what it will be lite to go into the wort force in their later years. As when you start a job, you must attend you job. So we should teach them this from a young age to paint the floor before they hit it. Because in life, you got to show up.

"The usage of summer projects is an undermined technique that schools implement to educate their students. It incorporates an application process to subjects and topics learned in Class, to real world settings. For many students, this process of application is enough to instill Certain topics into one's memory. Thus, to ensure that students receive a meaningful and valuable summer project, teachers should have the ability to design and Construct these assignments. The reason for this is that teachers effectively utilize summer projects to introduce new topics, have a better understanding of the Curriculum and subject, and Van emphasize Certain topics that are vital for students to understand. Many students might find the first quarter of a new school year a bit Cumbersome; however, with the aid of a teaVherdesigned summer project, students Van establishes a better academic foundation before entering the school year. This process of learning a topic before it is discussed or taught in school has may psychological and academic benefits. In the book Talent, the author describes the educational process as a learning Curve; for our purposes, only the first and second stages in this process are Critical to understanding the effects of teaVherdesigned projects. The first stage of this Curve is the data gathering process, where a person begins to input and understand the information into one's Conscious thinking: this is typically the longest and most difficult phase in the learning Curve. The second stage of this Curve is the application process, where people now have the ability to translate their newly acquired knowledge to a real scenario. A majority of students might not know this, but the first step in this learning Curve is what students experience in a Classroom, which is why students might not fully grasp a topic the first time it is taught. Connecting back to the prompt, the teaVherdesigned projects at as a Catalyst to this learning process, where students aren't starting at the bottom of the data gathering Curve, rather, they have already progressed through the first stage of learning. With a general foundation, students have a better ability to digest the information given during Class. Moreover, this state of being a faster learner has many psychological benefits; the most important one being a Confidence and morale boost. Essentially, feeling that you have this supernatural ability to easily absorb information boosts your Confidence in the Class, which, in return, increases your productivity in that Class. A teaVherVonstruVted summer project ensures that students Van begins this learning strategy by introducing new topics that will be discussed during the following year. An important notion that should be addressed is that most students do not have a developed understanding of a subject's Curriculum. However, teachers are trained and knowledgeable about the Course Curriculum, and have the ability to tailor the summer projects to the academic standards the students are expected to uphold. The issue with having a student designed summer project is that the students might not have the ability to distinguish between topics that are less or more important. On the Contrary, teachers posses the ability to guide their students to topics that are beneficial for them to understand. In other words, by allowing teachers to design the summer projects, students gain a better understanding to where the teacher is directing them throughout the new academic year. Despite the evidence listed, some students are still not satisfied with having a teaVherdesigned project during the summer. The major Claims they use to Corroborate their defense is that the projects designed by teachers are not interesting enough, or they do not necessarily appeal to the students' interest. First, it should be noted that these are very sensible and valid reasons to why someone might not want a teaVherdesigned summer project. In fact, when people to do not enjoy a Certain task, they loose motivation to Complete it. However, it should also be noted that teachers Consider this Claim when designing their projects. Personally, I have always received flexible summer assignments from my teachers, where they have allowed students to add information and topics they find interesting to the overarching theme of the project.

"Summer projects are something that some schools require students to complete. They are given, so students may continue to learn, even during their summer break. However, there is a debate whether summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. While some may argue that a teacher-designed project would give some guidance for the students, others believe that a summer project designed entirely by students would allow students to let them be more creative, students can choose a topic they like, and students can solve a problem they relate to. Summer projects should be entirely student-designed to give students a better learning experience during their break. First, students can choose a topic that they are interested in for their student project. For example, if a student likes video games, then they would be more motivated to do their project than a summer project with the topic of gardening. The students will be more motivated doing something they like, simply because they enjoy it. No one wants to do a project that no one likes. In addition to that, students may also be more knowledgeable in their topic if they are able to design their project. A student could know nothing about gardening and complete a poor project. However, if a student knows everything about video games, then that student can create a very excellent project, because it's a topic they like. Student-designed projects allows students to do what they want to do, and have control over it. Next, with a student-designed project, students can have more freedom in what they want to do. Some students may not like what topic the teacher gives for a project. This can decrease the motivation for some students to do it. However, with a student-designed project, students can be more creative with their project, because people like to learn what they are interested in. Freedom will also make students more motivated to complete their projects, because they are free to do anything. Freedom can also allow students to be critical thinkers. Some students are the ""go by the book"" students. This means they always follow what they are supposed to do and not think outside the box. Student-designed projects allow students to think differently and not just use what they have always learned in school. Freedom is key for summer projects. Lastly, students can choose a problem that students relate to. If a project asks for the solution to a problem, then students can choose a problem that affects them. This would allow students to have a better understanding of the problem and how to solve the problem. It would make students more motivated to try to create a solution, because of how the problem affects them. For example, if a student chooses a topic about global warming, most students know about the dangers associated with global warming, which gives that student a better understanding of the topic. In addition to that, the student would be more motivated in doing their project, because global warming affects that student and everybody else on Earth. Having a problem that students can relate to for a summer project would increase motivation and knowledge of the topic. Students should be able to design their summer projects to give students a better learning experience. The freedom to do anything, the ability to choose a topic, and solving a relatable problem are all associated with student-designed projects. Student projects will allow students to do whatever they want to do and be motivated. Motivation is the key idea for student-designed projects, because motivation is what drives students to succeed. After school is over, there will be no teacher-designed projects, and for good reason too. Students will have to do things on their own without someone telling them to in life. Student-designed projects are the key to a good education for all students during their summer break.",0.0,1,0.85213137,1
"What makes all students successful? This question can have many answers, and one of the most common answers could be that participating in at least one extracurricular activity will do the trick. It is strongly agreed upon that having all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity is a wise decision. Participating in an extracurricular activity can aid in the development of a well-rounded student. Students are fairly busy people, and while most try their best in school, many are still unaware of the things that they are capable of. Whether it be learning how to play an instrument or being on the student council, there are many things that students could participate in to develop a deeper understanding of the world around them. For example, learning a new skill like being able to play the violin can teach students about the fine motor skills that are required in order to play it. This new skill can open their minds to their possibilities and contribute to the identity of a student and who they are as a person. In addition, it can give a student knowledge in which they can enable later on in the future. Doing an activity outside of school can teach a student time management skills. When students have to spend time on work outside of school, they will learn how to use their time wisely. When they grow up to be adults, it will be easier for them to balance their social life with their work, and this will lead to successful work habits. Too many students these days are not managing their time well, and this leads to a decreased amount of sleep and poor performance. Learning these time management skills can change this, and instead result in healthy habits and better performance. Extracurricular activities can help students release stress. As students get older, they will have more responsibilities. This can lead to stress, and many students don't know how they can handle it. Requiring that each student participate in at least one extracurricular activity can help get their mind off of the stressful factors in their lives. For example, playing a sport can give a student something productive to do when they need to release their stress. At such a young age, it is important to develop students who are responsible, yet balanced. From these three reasons, it is clear how requiring that all students participate in an extracurricular activity is a wise decision. While it is understood that extracurricular activities can pull time out of a student's daily life, it is more important to consider how much time they need instead of how much time they want. In summary, requiring that each student participate in at least one extracurricular activity is a smart decision because it will develop a well-rounded student, teach time management skills, and help students release their stress. If you want to be ensured these results for the present and the future, I urge you to support the participation of all Generic_School students in at least one extracurricular activity.",0.0,1,0.99662775,1
"Dear Principal, I completely disagree with your proposed policy change that if passed would not allow students to participate in sports or other activities unless they have a Q minimum average. This policy would be unfair to students. It is unacceptable because sports or other activities besides academics are valuable to students. Activities that are not academic related, such as arts and crafts, music, sports, etc. are mandatory in school because school is not just a learning environment for academics and nonacademic activities may help students' performance in academic subjects. Nonacademic activities are important in school because children need to be stimulated in all areas, not just academics. If school didn't have music, sports, etc., then students would not be able to exercise their other talents, unless they had opportunities to do so outside of school. School is a place where students grow, and if students are only growing in an academic area, then they are not fully maturing. Nonacademic activities are also required because those activities can help improve students' performance in academics. For example, if a child had a sports elective before his final math exam, he could use the sport to distract himself from being nervous. Once he got to his next class, he was not nervous, and he did well on his test. Performing nonscholastic activities can help performance in scholastic activities. Overall, Principal, you cannot put this policy in place. It would contradict the purpose of school, and it may degrade the academic performance of students. STUDENT_NAME",0.0,1,0.97731006,1
"Summer is an important time of the year for students; it is a good time for rest, but it is also a good time for further education. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue their learning during their break. These projects should be student designed rather than teacher designed because, by designing their own projects, students can learn more about what interests them, express themselves creatively, and gain more responsibility. However, some people who disagree with this point of view may say that teacher designed projects can be designed to fit into the next schoolyard's curriculum allowing students to prepare for their next year of learning. For example, if environmental health is a significant theme in the 10th grade science curriculum, teachers can design summer projects for rising 10th graders about the environment, so they get a head start in understanding the subject. While this argument may be true, specific, teacher designed projects take away the many positive effects of student designed projects, including the ability to learn more about personal interests. Student designed summer projects allow students to learn more about the interests they have. For example, if a student is very interested in government, he or she can complete a summer project about the two party system in the United States, the bicameral system in Congress, or even the differences between government at the federal and state levels. Discovering more about personal interests is essential to students. By finding out more about what they like, students have many more opportunities in front of them. Personal interests lead to college and career interests, which lead to structure in adult life. Students can express themselves and use creativity when designing their own projects. For example, if students are allowed to decide how they present their projects, they can express themselves through drawing, painting, photography, or even web design. If students can express themselves creatively, they can free their minds, decrease stress, and become further engaged in their learning. Teacher designed projects would destroy this creativity, and students would be stuck in a noncreative box. If this were the case, students would become bored, and the negatives would far outweigh the positives. Student designed projects give students more responsibility. For example, if a student was assigned a teacher designed summer project, he or she would only be responsible for completing the project; but if he or she was told to design and complete a project, he or she would have to research possible topics, search for relevant information, find ways to present it, create a plan, and execute the plan. This shows that students have significantly more responsibility when designing projects themselves. This responsibility will train students and teach them how to work independently, which is an essential life skill. If students completed a teacher designed summer project, they would not learn this skill as well as they would when designing a project on their own. Simply stated, teacher designed summer projects do not provide the many benefits of independent summer projects students design on their own. If a student was assigned a teacher made project, he or she would miss out on personal interest discovery, creativity, and responsibility. Bore schools should replace teacher designed summer projects with student designed projects.",0.0,1,0.98207444,1
"As a student who attends a public school, I have noticed that everyone has different accommodations for their needs. I believe it is important to take into consideration these needs and act upon them so that everyone can be satisfied in their environment. One example that has come to my attention is distance learning. Distance learning is basically school from home, either online or through video conferencing. Schools that offer distance learning could benefit students, as there are many people who suffer from mental health issues and physically cannot attend school. However, students could easily take advantage of this opportunity through cheating. Mental health issues are a worldwide problem that are not easy to escape. I happen to be good friends with someone who has a slightly extreme case of Lyme Disease that affects her mental health on a daily basis, and makes it very hard for her to get out of bed each day and attend school. She rarely came to school enough to finish her sophomore year. In response to this, the administration gave her the opportunity to attend school through a computer screen, which benefited her Must as much as anyone who physically attends school. It benefitted her by giving her the chance to learn every day from her bed, and it was easier on her mental health. Although there are many benefits to online school, there are also negative factors that play into it. As I mentioned earlier, students could easily take advantage of this opportunity through cheating. Yes, this could benefit an individual because then maybe they would be getting good grades, but in the long run they are only hurting themselves. Schools provide long distance education so that they can take into consideration every one's needs, not to give students a chance to cheat. In conclusion, distance learning could certainly benefit the students who truly need it, as it provides easy access to learning from home. If one were to decide to do online school, I believe the schools' administration should see if that person really needs it to their benefit, or if they Must want the chance to do it to take advantage of it. There are many people in this world who have different accommodations to satisfy their needs, and if online school is granted to them, they should take the opportunity of it to their benefit.",0.0,1,0.9482489,1

"Summer projects should be student-designed as long as the teacher is still in control of the overall process. This system engages the students more, while also ensuring that they continue to learn over the break. As a rule, students are more likely to complete an assignment and enjoy doing so if they have control over the parameters of the assignment. If a student is interested in a certain field of study, they should be able to freely explore and learn about it. Designing their own assignment would allow them to do this. For example, one student might be fascinated with astronomy and another student with biology. Allowing them to create their own projects to study these fields would pique their interest in learning and may also help them understand which career field might suit them best. However, with a student-designed project, it is possible that the student will ""slack off"" and design a project that does not truly benefit their learning. For example, a student might design a science experiment that with the research question of ""what is the effect of temperature on ice?"" Although this question sounds valid, it is not since it is easily answered. Most people already know that ice melts as the temperature increases. Therefore, the student will not have to put in much effort or even conduct the experiment in order to know the outcome. In order to prevent this from happening, teachers should supervise the designing of these projects. This can be done before the students leave school for the summer or the students can submit project proposals to the teacher over the summer. If teachers do this, they will be able to verify that their students' projects are possible and refine them. Often times, students have good ideas, but do not know how to execute them or are unable to because they do not have the necessary resources. Teachers will also be able to catch the projects that are too ""obvious"" or easy. Although student-designed projects can go awry, they can also be very successful if they are created with the guidance of a teacher. Students should be given every opportunity to learn on their own and explore their individual passions.",0.0,1,0.64564645,1
"Have you ever wondered about your working skills do you prefer working in groups or on your own? How they benefit you in your job or anywhere else? People say that working together is a better way of doing stuff then just working alone. But theirs other people who prefer working alone. Here are some of the benefits to both sides. I feel like working in a group is more beneficial because it lets you have a chance to ear new ideas. You can also finish the work faster if everyone is doing something. For example this one time. My friends and I were doing a project for drives Ed. We had some time to think and write down ideas. After that all of us got together and agreed on some ideas. Then we each had our own part to do, and we finished it during class. Some people believe that working alone is better. You can be more focused on you work. In addition you can be more creative in your own way. I remember this girl in my biology class had to do her finial exam project. She decided to work by herself. The girl was res reaching and was really focused on that she was looking for. She got her information then made a really creative poster that went with the theme of the project. The teacher loved it and gave her an A for it. In conclusion working in a group benefits me the most. There is less work to do. Everyone has good ideas.

"I disagree with what John Lubbock said ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" I strongly disagree because we are influenced by the people we hang out with. Like for example in America we have different accents all around the map and that's because the people near us influence one another. They influence one another by sharing cultures and beliefs. For example in Louisiana they have Martina, but it did not originate in Louisiana, in New York they have a lot of Italian people, and we all enjoy eating ethic food such as Chinese food, tacos, popular, Italian food. All of those things influenced Americans and their traditions and customs which impacts their morals. As we all know everyone has morals, but those morals are influenced by people, such as our friends, family, teachers and coworkers. Nnes morals has a big role in character. I would even say it's the biggest factor in what build spur character. A persons moral is what tells them what is right and what is wrong, what they should do or what they should not do, whether to pick option A or option B. Morals are a part of someone's character, It's what builds their character. For example if someone's morals aren't made up, and they do not know what is good and bad then their character might need some work. I get where Mr. Lubbock gets the idea of ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it"" but I also think that social class has a lot to do with your character. I think that the different social groups have a variety of character building factors. Furthermore, I believe this because for example a person that only makes 20 grand a year has a lot more struggles than a person that makes 100 grand a year and those struggles impact one's character. In conclusion, I disagree with John Lubbock because I believe morals, social class and people around us influence our character. I believe all those factors play a major role on who we are because it is human nature to adapt to surroundings.",0.0,1,0.56915855,1
"Distance learning is defined as online classes or video conferencing. In other words, it's homeschooling. Students who are enrolled in distance learning usually end up in that position due to life factors such as bullying, disabilities, or mental illness. The discussion of whether this is beneficial or detrimental to students is a gray area, with both sides making reasonable arguments. However, I personally am against distance learning. Homeschooling offers a controlled environment with little disruption, but it hinders a child's social skills. Although learning in one's household gives students more freedom in the day to move around when they want, they also have the freedom to ignore their responsibilities and not do the work. A student's concentration levels can increase, but staring at a screen for long periods of time can cause irritation to the eyes. There's nothing wrong with the idea of taking lessons outside of school, but to be aware of the issues with learning from home is necessary. For starters, distance learning contributes very little to the social skills of a student. Imagine pulling a child out of school, away from their friends and favorite teachers, and plopping them down in an empty room with nothing but a computer and some scratch paper and telling them, ""This is how you're going to take lessons from now on"". Although this can be resourceful to students on the autism spectrum or other health problems, keeping them stuck inside a house all alone may do more harm than good. For example, an old friend of mine from Generic_City is homeschooled. While they didn't mind it, they would oftentimes gripe about how unbearably lonely and depressed they were; they couldn't go anywhere, there was nothing to do and there was nobody they knew in real life to talk to. Students will be unable to engage in opportunities to interact with people around their age, nor can they participate in any events or extracurricular activities. As a result, they could grow up socially awkward or verbally impulsive, negatively affecting their chance at proper growth. Secondly, the concept of students working at home can be difficult to manage. When a teenager takes online classes or video conferencing, nobody is making sure they're doing their assignments. Young people are lazy by nature; when a teacher or adult leaves the room, we lose focus and chat among each other. In a controlled environment this wouldn't be a problem, but with nobody supervising the student, it makes it easier for them to neglect their classwork and do whatever they want. When I took homeschooling for a mere three days, I did very little of my homework; I found the task boring and pointless, and eventually I returned to public school. Additionally, online classroom assignments are more time-consuming and challenging than what public school has to offer. This only further discourages the student from applying any amount of effort into their classwork, especially if they cannot understand the subject. Finally, the reason why distance learning is not as effective as in school learning is due to how home bound students are taught. In today's age we learn with the help of technology, using sideshows and laptops to simplify lessons for the young. Students in public school, while relying on electronics for information, don't get as much screen time as homeschooled kids do; taking online classes requires a computer. If a homeschooled student spends this much time scrolling and clicking through each and every lesson, that would mean the average screen time they receive is twice more than what publicly schooled students are exposed to. As harmless as it may sound, staring at a bright white screen can cause irritation to the eyes, causing tension headaches or nearsightedness; it can wear out your back or increase the likelihood of suffering from depression or anxiety. I used to have an addiction to my electronic devices. As a result, I was cranky and miserable, and my eyes and back were sore from sitting hunched over my phone. If a student benefits from learning through a computer, there is nothing wrong with that. That doesn't mean, however, every homeschooled child can afford to stare at a screen for hours a day without feeling physically or mentally drained. We all want the best for our youth, but doing that requires the process of making difficult choices. Distance learning provides an opportunity for students, yet doing so may hurt their behaviors in secretive ways. Students specifically those with mental disabilities can thrive in a learning environment without the fear of being bullied, but it can prevent them from meeting new people in both the classroom and in an after school activity. Homeschooling has a more controlled, less disruptive environment, yet with no teacher present it can give way to laziness. Technology makes learning easier, but for students who have to learn electronically every day, their physical and mental health are at risk of harm. The solution to this would be to eventually enroll a child into public schooling once they're at an appropriate age; distance learning is effective to others depending on their character, but as they grow up, it's better for them to develop and flourish alongside students in their grade rather than by themselves.",0.0,1,0.95021236,1

It would be unfair to only let B average students participate in recreational activities because not everyone is great at school, but they do look forward to being active and healthy.

"Dear Principal, I think that changing the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they maintain a grade B average instead of a grade C average is a great idea. Not only will this encourage students increase their grade average, but it will reward the students who have higher grades. Many students consider being able to participate in activities or privilege that they want. This means that students will want to raise their grades in order to be able to have this privilege. I know I would. Many students don't try hard to do over the bare minimum of a C average, so they could be able to participate in activities and sports, but raising the minimum to a B would mean that everyone would need to try harder if they would want to be able to participate in activities. Students who do not keep an average high enough to play sports would have more time for studying, so that they can raise their grade high enough to play in sports. Students who have a high enough grade to play will be rewarded and will feel special about having higher grades. This will encourage them to try even harder and be a better student. This could give them a better chance at getting into a more respectable college, and bring them more success over the course of their lifetime. I think that you should increase the grade average required to participate in activities, because it will encourage students who aren't doing too well to do better, and even the students who are already achieving the required marks to do better, resulting in them to have a better quality education.

"To my friends, I am known as ""that robot-loving girl"". They are not wrong. I have been a longtime lover of the Transformers franchise; unfortunately, in my tightly-knit group of friends, there is not one person who shares that interest. On the other hand, the online community of my fellow Transformers fans has helped me band together with people all around the world in multiple collaborative projects. My sole lament is that I could not share this place with others I personally know; however, I know that extracurriculars would allow me to do just so. Although mandatory participation in an extracurricular would seem to many like a bore, they would introduce students to new interests to determine a possible career path, allow students connect with others, and give students an opportunity to learn crucial skills. It is no secret that many middle school students are hesitant when faced with the question of a prospective career. However, this is mainly because many have never explored the different opportunities that would lead them to their passions - after all, there is no regret when doing something that one loves. Subsequently, middle school is the perfect time to try new activities in order to determine a possible career path. Unlike high school, in which many people begin to feel the time-erasing effects of an overwhelming tide of work, middle school is a time for exploring one's own interests. When I started eighth grade, I enrolled in an elective called ""Computers in Art"", using programs to create digital animations. I hoped to develop my artistic abilities and apply my interest in art to the Transformers community. Unfortunately, the allotted fifty minutes was never enough; often, with no way of contacting my teammates, I had to resort to working on projects as time-consuming homework. On the other hand, if there happened to be an extracurricular dedicated to film making and animation, the two hours after school that I could spend working on my film - alongside my teammates - would be well worth it. Furthermore, the sheer experience led me to determine that art was definitely a career that I wish to pursue. On the other hand, I also have a deep interest in writing; unfortunately, with nobody to discuss those ideas with, many simply stay as conflicting ideas with the sole question of ""Am I worthy enough to be an author someday?"" Extracurriculars would allow me to reach out and explore the many opportunities that would lead me to a job that I enjoy. Going hand-in-hand with the discovery of self-interests and career choices, extracurriculars also provide many a chance to discover people with a common self-interest. Many students circulating throughout Generic_School have uncommon - or even bizarre - interests. Unfortunately, this means that many do not have an outlet to express those thoughts. Even with the prospect of electives, many people are simply not inclined with reaching out to others for fear of rejection. For example, my Computers in Art class was all about film making; however, I was always hesitant to discuss Transformers - ""those giant metal things,"" my friend said - even with the group of friends that I always worked with. Even more so, I hated talking about anime, a type of Japanese cartoon - this was not because I despised it, but rather because many of its fans are commonly stereotyped as cringeworthy. One day - not in Computers in Art, surprisingly, but rather in Physical Education - I offhandedly mentioned to my dance group about one of my favorite anime series. One of my group members - who, until this point, I hardly ever talked to - immediately reacted with elation, stating that she was also a fan of the series. We became friends, especially after I introduced her to the many online sites dedicated to anime; with extracurriculars, I am sure that I would have not only met her faster, but that other people would also have the chance to meet new people with their same interests. Lastly, a majority of clubs are team-based. Over the years, I have seen many students groan and complain when the teacher announces a group project; they are not completely at fault, given the many group project horror stories when one person does not do their share of work. Since many extracurriculars are team-based, they would provide helpful insight into skills that would be useful to a career in the future, such as collaboration, communication, and unfortunately, compensating for any teammate who may be slacking off. During one of my explorations of the Transformers community, I stumbled across a group of people asking for assistance in starting a fanzine called ""Transformers Snapshots"". I immediately took up the offer. Together, with many strangers around the world, we put together a fan magazine with artworks and stories from fans. Although we were sometimes faced with the unfortunate prospect of a creator dropping out of the project due to personal reasons, we had to immediately reach out and find a person to fill up the empty slot. Even in the real world, I have faced this topic in the debate team; every single time we prepare for a tournament, the team holds mock debates. Even when writing our manuscripts, discussing possible contentions and rebuttals with one's teammates is always a must; nothing is viable without teamwork and communication. Many extracurriculars would extend this opportunity to others. School, especially middle school, is not just a place for learning; it is a place of self-discovery and finding what floats one's boat. The real world is filled with challenges and, in the face of those challenges, it is the school's responsibility to prepare students for those challenges. Preparing means extracurriculars; these activities would allow many to set their future job, bond with people over common interests, and build skills necessary for said job; only then will the school have fulfilled its duty.",0.0,1,0.9971572,1
"If the story was told in first person then it would be telling us about how Luke thinks or feels. It would also say what he thinks about what he is done, what he thinks about his friends, and what he thinks of helping others. But I bet he would think nice things about helping people because he said that he liked the job. And when his friend asked him if he wanted to EO with him, he said that it was a once in a lifetime opportunity that it he didn't want to miss. He also said that it would be great to be in a helping team, and he also liked the journey engine to Europe with his friend. Plus we would have know what he thought about the journey, the place he was helping and the job. And don't say that I'm wrote because it is true. And this is how it would look like if the story was in first person. We would also know what he thought about Italy, a city with streets of water. Plus we would also know what he thought about the castle and China. And we would have know how he felt when he cracked his ribs, or about the animal hard job. And what about all that fun that he had with his new friends playing baseball, volleyball, table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing reading, and whittling.

"Have you ever needed advice? Most people have to ask other people for different opinions at many points in their lives. When someone wants advice, they may talk to multiple people instead of just one. When more than one person is asked, these people will usually have differing opinions. It is important to seek multiple opinions when looking for advice because people with different experiences may have different ideas, one might not feel comfortable with their first option, and one can combine the ideas of others to come up with their own plan. A good reason to look for more than one opinion is that people with different pasts lead will believe different things. Often, no two people in a room will have the same experiences or ideas, so asking more than one person allows one to weigh these opinions and choose the best option for their situation. For example, a man who grew up with multiple rowdy older brothers and a woman who had no siblings might have different ideas on how to handle a disagreement between friends. Their experiences had led them to believe different things, but that does not mean that either one was wrong. They just grew up learning different ways to manage situations, leading to them giving different advice. If someone asks multiple people the same question, they are likely to find different ideas from people with different backgrounds. A different reason to get advice from multiple people is that one's first option might not feel right for them. Different people have differing personalities, and what one feels like they could do may not seem feasible for another. One example of this is if a shy, studious, and introverted boy asks for advice from his boisterous, popular, and sporty older sister on how to stand up for himself. If the sister tells him to do something such as loudly tell the bully to stop and then walk away, the boy might have been better served by asking his mother, who also would prefer to be quiet and not bothered by other people. In this example, the boy would not have been served well by using his sister's idea because he would not have felt like he could pull it off. Through getting more than one opinion, one can find a solution that matches what they might be able to do, not just what might work for someone else. Lastly, one should get advice from more than one person because they can build their own solution based on parts of the suggestions of other people. When people combine the ideas of others, it can often lead to a plan that is more thought out than it would otherwise be. An example of this principle is if a boy asks his mother and father how to talk to his teacher about an incorrect grade. If his mother tells him to schedule a time to explain the situation and his father says that he should bring in the assignment and show the teacher without notice, he could take the best parts of both and schedule a time to meet while also coming in with the materials to show the teacher exactly what was going on. Once he had gotten multiple ideas, he was able to put them together and make a stronger plan. This is always a possibility if one uses the opinions of many people, rather than just one. People need to look for multiple sources of advice because different ideas come from people with different backgrounds, some people may not feel able to use the first option given to them, and others' ideas can be put together to make a new, stronger idea. If people who grew up in different countries all give advice on the same topic, the one asking can see a diverse range of ideas. The first person to answer may have had advice that disagreed with the asker's beliefs, but they are able to move on to a new person. Afterwards, the asker can take all of the advice that they were given and cobble together their own idea based on what they had heard. All in all, there are many reasons that one should take many people's answers when they are asking for advice.",0.0,1,0.9812609,1
"Today I've been called to the NASA facility to discuss a certain topic. I am unaware of that this all about. As I enter the doors to the room their the meeting hill take place, I see my fellow coworkers with the same confused expression. Our boss, who is usually quite loud, is unusually quiet, giving us the idea that this is very serious. As he clears his throat, everyone finds a seat and settles down. I take a seat in the back right corner so that I can see everyone expressions during the meeting. ""Hello,"" our boss says loudly, starting his speech, ""and welcome. I apologize for this unexpected meeting. Trust me, I haven't very thrilled to be here either. But I have gotten some unexpected images from Viking 1. It is very... strange. So without further due...."" He takes a remote like thing and turns on the protector, showing an image on the hall. As I look around the room from my corner, I see a number of expressions, some confused, some amused, some even a bit worried. But one expression stands out. A NEH guy, I'd say he's been here for about a few weeks, is tho seats next to me, mumbling something under his breath. I give him a strange look. He seems frightened. As his mumbles get louder, more people start to stare. ""Tithe aliens did this. I... I know it!"" The room bursts into laughter. I give a few chuckles as hell. I mean, come on not. Aliens? ""Alright, alright. Settle down not. Have some respect. Let him give his point of view,"" the boss says. I guess he has a point. As the room gets quiet again, all the attention goes towards Mr. NEH Guy. He begins speaking. ""You guys think it's funny, but think about it! If you think that in the WHOLE universe, he is the only form of life, you're ignorant."" Is this guy serious? ""Everyone knows that aliens are smart! They could've easily built that landform to mock humans!"" I can't take this nonsense anymore. I casually raise my hand, waiting for the majority to acknowledge it. When I feel that I've gotten enough peoples attention, I begin to talk. ""Listen. I understand that he may not be the only life form in the universe, but do you really think that aliens built that? You said it yourself man. It's a landform. A natural landform."" I slowly get up and make my hay to the hall their the image is being displayed. ""Do you see this?"" I point the ""eye"" of the landform. ""This is a shadow. Nothing more, nothing less. As hell as this other ""eye"" and the rest of the darkness making it seem like this landform has a face. It's Gust the angle of Viking 1 and their it has then the picture has taken. It Gusts so happens that it looks like a human face. Not I agree, it is kind of hard. But Viking 1 takes a lot of photos. Don't you think there would be at least a few pictures with aliens making it? Sorry man, but your theory Gust isn't adding up."" There is a small applause as I half back to my seat. Mr. NEH Guy doesn't look very happy. He looks a bit relieved though. ""Well,"" boss starts speaking, ""I suppose he has our answer already. Just a simple landform. Alright guys. You all are dismissed. Have a nice night."" He begins packing his things. I get up and head out. As I get in the car I sigh. ""Well, that has a haste of time.""",0.0,1,0.9430165,1
"Education Ls a vital component to modern society's success, and Lt Ls Imperative that every child Ln this world be given the opportunity to receive a proper schooling. It Ls not only Important that a child be given the opportunity to learn, but Lt Ls a child's basic right. In addition to being provided with education, a child must be provided a safe learning environment Ln order to allow HLM or her to prosper and succeed. Unfortunately, this Ls not always the case, and many children come home Ln tears or are unable to focus Ln the poor conditions present at the schools they attend. To combat this Issue and provide schooling to a larger demographic, many school systems have Implemented online schooling from home as an alternative to attending the school physically. This form of schooling has significant benefits to the students as Lt allows them to work Ln an environment comfortable to them, allows for easier access to an educational database, and allows them to work at their own pace. Online schooling allows students to attend school from the comfort of their own home or wherever else they deem flt. Students have the freedom of choice and are able to learn from wherever they learn best from. This allows them to truly be engaged with the materiel being taught and allows them to retain more as they are not stressed about external or social factors. Often times Ln school settings, kids are worried about what their peers think about them, how they look, how they talk, bullying, etc. All of these factors combined create a negative learning environment and hinder many from achieving their true potentials. By providing an online schooling experience, many of this risks are mitigated, and students do not have to worry about anything other than what Ls being taught to them. This Increases focus levels and allows students to learn better. Online school allows students to feel safe and secure, creating a more positive environment, allowing for future success and prosperity. By giving students an environment Ln which they can learn and grow, students well be able to become active members of the community and well be able to benefit their society with their skill sets and determination towards the betterment of the future. In addition to providing students access to a comfortable and safe learning environment, online schooling allows students to have access to school at the touch of a button. Due to natural disasters, deadly diseases, and poor transportation systems, many students find Lt difficult or nearly Impossible to get to school on time or at all on some occasions. This hinders many children's abilities to learn as they simply cannot get to school. Giving students the access to this same schooling from home eliminates many of these Issues and allows students to not have to worry about getting to school as they are already there. This allows students to have higher attendance rates and allows them to learn more as they are almost always present Ln the learning environment. In addition, this type of schooling Ls especially helpful for those that love far from their the nearest school. Some kids can spend up to two hours a day just setting on transportation alone. This time could be used more productively and undergoes a significant opportunity cost. Students get home tired from being Ln transport for so long and are thus unable to perform and do work up to maximum efficiency. Allowing students to work from home saves them time and allows them to spend this time further enriching themselves and delving Into other academic or extracurricular ventures. This allows students to become more well-rounded and overall, better and more successful people. In addition to providing students access to school from the comfort of their own home and saving them time Ln transportation, online schooling allows students to work at a pace comfortable to them. Online schooling gives students access to all the resources they could need to succeed. This gives them the ability to learn Ln a manner that best fits their personal learning style and work at a pace that they are comfortable with. Since they have everything they could need, they do not have to scavenge through oldfashLoned textbooks or stacks upon stacks of paper. Everything Ls available to them by simple clocks on a computer, allowing for Information to be communicated more effectively and efficiently between student and teacher. This allows the student to not have to stress about keeping up with other students' speed of work as he or she can finish on HLS or her own time. The students do not need to be worried about how fast the teacher Ls going as they can just rewatch a recording of the video later. Online schools gave students the freedom to work worry free and at a speed that they know they can succeed Ln. This, Ln turn, allows students to absorb more Information and work diligently towards their goals. Giving students the opportunity to work at their own pace allows for them to become better time managers and more organized as they have to make schedules by themselves. It lets children become more Independent and prepares them better for the future, more than any physical school could. While many people may think that online schools are unable to provide the same experience and Hanson learning as physical schools, this Ls simply a modern misconception. In reality, online schools do an exceptional job at providing the exact same, LF not better, education to their students. They ensure to provide a Hanson learning experience through engaging and Interactive activities and lectures. Online schools are simply not Inferior to physical schools Ln anyway and Ln some cases, are more advantageous to their students. The advancement of the Internet and the extensive Infrastructure online schools have built enable them to provide their students with a comprehensive education without sacrificing any liberties present Ln physical schools.",0.0,1,0.9978544,1
"On Maw 24, 2001, NASA found something funny on Mars. The Viking 1 spacecraft was taking photos of possible landings sites for Viking 2. During that time, it spotted something that appeared to be an enormous head. It looked like an Egyptian pharaoh, but turned out to be a regular, old mesa. It is still debated whether it was created by ancient Martian life, or whether is just another regular landform on Mars. MW coworkers and I thought this was incredible. We had just found something that could have proven ancient life on Mars. It turned out that it wasn't. Later, we figured out that it was another regular Martian mesa. We were so excited when we thought we had just found proof of earlier life on Mars. We thought we had just made one of the greatest scientific discoveries there has ever been. Furthermore, we were joyful when we saw the Face. Furthermore, we thought we found proof of ancient alien life without even looking for it. Some people think that the mesa was actually created by aliens. In paragraph 5, it saws that people thought NASA was just trying to hide all the information. To be honest, we were hoping it was proof of alien life. We wanted to find proof of alien life. WHW would we hide that information? That just doesn't make ANW sense whatsoever. The Face is just a landform. In paragraph 2, it saws that Marian mesas were common in the area the Face was in, Colonia. Also, the shadows were the only things that made the Martian mesa look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. All that saws is that a landform could be luck and have some features that made it resembles someone. Plus, how would Martians know what a Pharaoh looks like? Thew would be from Mars and not Earth. Thew most likely don't know anyone that even looks like an Egyptian Pharaoh. In conclusion, the face is just a natural landform. It maw look like a head, but that is just because of the unusual shadows that the mesa has.

"I agree with the principal's decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity in school because it is an excellent way to find interests in leisure time, improve people's social and health lives, and it has an important role in serving the community and academic success. First, many students, especially teenagers, spend a vast amount of time on social medias and cellular devices. It may lead to negative consequences such as lack of self control and self management, imperfect grades, and even cyberbullying. Before students become mature enough to handle their own situations, adults should be the supervisors and help them get on the right track. Sometimes it is acceptable to force people to on a certain task for their own benefits. Therefore, extracurricular activities is a great option when it comes to after school life. Students may seek their true interests through these experiences and even more, find the purpose of their lives. For instance, a student who participates in a student council may find a big interest in politics or management; another student who works on the yearbook might seek a great favor in arts and photography. Moreover, there is a possibility that some people can target what they want to major in for the future. Additionally, extracurricular activities may contribute to students' health and social lives by creating opportunities such as teamwork and group projects. Besides focusing on school grades, students should also pay attention on developing relationships and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, all of these are going to be helpful for having great experiences in the society. Many students crave for a sense of belonging, and they often find unexpected gains in extracurricular activities such as friendship or a healthy lifestyle. For example, playing sports can exercise your body and strengthen your muscles, when people get older, it can even prevent typical diseases for a longer life span. Also, sport teams often develop communication and teamwork skills, through these activities, students are able to make new friends by talking about topics that they are interested in, and these relationships can also be a source of strength when people come into challenges and difficulties in life. It is a positive way for students to be physically and mentally prepared for the future. Furthermore, extracurricular activities is a nice way to contribute to the school, and it can even be beneficial to academic success. School provides an educational environment for students and students can participate in activities such as school board or the announcements and news program to serve back to the school. In a way, it has the same meaning and purpose as community service, it advocates for serving others and offers many experience that are helpful to the society. On the other hand, participating in extracurricular activities may serve as a great advantage in high school or college applications, every school looks forward to accepting students who are willing to spend effort on things that they are interested in, and at the same time know the importance of serving back to the community. In conclusion, extracurricular activities have many benefits for students' academic and after school lives such as finding one's personal interests, adding more values to one's social and health life, and lastly, serving the community while being grateful for nice things in the world. With all these advantages, I think it would be a beneficial decision to suggest students to engage in extracurricular activities.",0.0,1,0.98856246,1
"The policy ZF some schools requiring students TZ complete summer projects allows students TZ continue learning and challenging themselves academically when school is but ZF session. In order TZ encourage students TZ develop their creative and organizational skills, these summer projects should be designed by the students themselves. Cith the freedom ZF designing their own projects, students are also better able explore their own intellectual interests. Students must apply their creative skills when they are given autonomy in designing their assignments. My past history teacher assigned a project in which students were TZ select any event in history and present it through any medium. The students used creativity in crafting dioramas, drawing Zn large posters, constructing websites, and even conveying information through theatrical performances. The grading structure was based Zn how much effort was apparently put into each project, and this motivated students TZ work hard and make their projects unique. Students have the liberty and incentive TZ express their interests creatively if they design their own projects. Students can hone their organizational skills by structuring a project without a teacher's strict guidelines. Although guidelines are arguably necessary TZ any graded assignment, a teacher should create guidelines based Zn creativity and display ZF knowledge rather than conformity. In a student based project, organizational skills beneficial TZ academic success are engaged, such as deciding Zn a main idea, providing evidence and examples, using pictures Zr diagrams for clarity, and practicing presentation techniques. In math class last year, I was assigned a project in which the only requirement was TZ explain a mathematical concept. Despite not having any background knowledge about website creation, I decided TZ make a website. I learned how TZ insert links and tabs dedicated TZ different mathematical topics. This experience taught me how TZ organize information into digital form. The ability TZ independently design an assignment is educational in that it develops students' ability TZ organize information in a clear, methodical way. Students will have the freedom TZ learn about and pursue their interests if they design their own projects. A teacher might have TZ restrict a project TZ a specific theme Zr subject, such as Medieval Europe. However, providing students some flexibility within a subject TZ work Zn the aspect that they feel most passionate about will lead TZ more enthusiasm. For example, my ecology teacher assigned students a research project Zn biz mes. I was extremely curious about the tundra but less SZ about the grasslands. Unfortunately, I had TZ research the grasslands instead ZF the tundra. I was largely apathetic about the subject, and although I learned some new facts, I believed zing a project Zn the tundra would have been a more educational experience for me. A student designed project allows students TZ nurture their curiosity while completing academic work. By allowing students TZ design their own projects, students are less restricted by guidelines and are thus further enabled TZ develop their creative and organizational skills. Students are also able TZ learn about subjects that they already find interesting and worthy ZF further research, and will therefore be more enthusiastic about the assignment.",0.0,1,0.9926042,1

"The freedom to make a hot cup of coffee while writing a book report, or watch a television series while doing math, undoubtedly sparks feelings of content among students. Throughout the country, some schools have worked to make this a reality, offering students the option of 'distance learning', which is a means by which students can take classes from home through online or video conferencing. In the 21st century, technological development is playing an increasingly larger role in several aspects of society, including educational institutions. The question of how and to what extent these innovations should be integrated serves as a subject for debate. Distance learning should not be an option for all students as it does not induce the same motivation as does a classroom setting, it creates the possibility for students to take advantage of the freedom, and students would not be given the chance to develop certain social skills necessary for their success in the real world. One's home is, oftentimes, an environment which establishes a sense of comfort. This setting, compared to a classroom, removes the aspect of healthy competition among students and inhibits a student's drive to accomplish tasks through peer2peer interactions. For example, to the student at home, his or her own grade is the highest, as it is the only point of comparison for him or her. However, at school, academic competition among peers allows for students to push themselves outside their comfort zone, achieving their highest potentials. Additionally, the motivation of a student who takes classes from home is less than that of a student in a classroom as students at school are more exposed to the opportunities that other students have taken advantage of, such as sports and extracurriculars. This allows a student in school become motivated to simply engage in more activities and accomplish more in his or her fields of interest. The interaction that school promotes creates motivation among students and allows them to engage in healthy competition, while accomplishments more in their academic career. Beyond this, distance learning allows for students to take advantage of their freedoms at home, which undeniably serve as a distraction to their academics. For example, at home, a student may be tempted to watch television, or take a nap as there is no teacher or administrator to effectively enforce certain rules and guidelines on the student. This situation makes a student's ability to stay on task extremely difficult, hence negatively impacting that student's success academically. However, if the student were taking classes at school, they are required, by the teacher, to focus on the lesson and complete tasks in a timely manner for their grade. Taking classes at home allows a student to procrastinate their assignments, with no tangible consequence. Because of this, distance learning allows students to take advantage of their freedoms at home, which, in the long run, has an unfavorable effect on that student's academic success. Furthermore, taking classes at home hinders students' development of social skills, which are beneficial to the success of individuals in the real world. For example, students at school are frequently required to make presentations and connect with other students for group projects. At school, students can also ask their peers for help or advice on assignments. These opportunities at school sculpt a student's ability to develop imperative interpersonal skills, while promoting sociable behavior among students. Through distance learning, however, a student is not exposed to these situations; therefore, they are unable to make the same connections and develop these skills necessary for college or the real life situations. Although supporters of distance learning may argue against this point by claiming that taking classes at home could be made a possibility for younger students in elementary school as they are generally not required to give presentations, this claim is unsupported as several important social skills are developed at a very young age, according to several studies regarding brain connections. Through distance learning, a student is unexposed to opportunities for developing integral social skills, which are necessary for his or her success in the future. Distance learning, the concept of making at home classes an option for students, is unsupported due to the fact that it does not promote the same motivation as a classroom, allows students to take advantage of their freedoms at home, and does not allow student's to develop their interpersonal skills. These factors would negatively influence a student's academic success, which is irrefutably counterintuitive to the intended purpose of educational institutions.",0.0,1,0.954878,1

"Dear TEACHER_NAME: Community Service is a very important aspect of life. As a firm believer in this, I would ask you to consider that all students of SCHOOL_NAME take part in community service. As Christians, we are called to administer to the needs of the poor, but if this school is not pushing for it than how are we fulfilling our duties as Christians? Whether it's working in soup kitchens downtown or helping babysit a neighbor, we should be striving to answer our call from God. I have done community service with my peers and during my experiences, I have encountered many people from various ages, genders, races, and social classes. From every trip I have gained a valuable experience. During one of my experiences, I was working in a soup kitchen in downtown Cleveland. Although intimidating at first, I helped by serving those who didn't have the same gifts I am blessed with. Isn't that what we are called to do? Serve others like Jesus did? I learned from this that every human person is valuable and should be treated with dignity and respect. Wouldn't you like all of the students at SCHOOL_NAME to participate in such a great journey of faith and attempt to carry out what we are taught by Jesus Christ? I believe by helping our society to become a better place is why we are put here on this earth, but we shouldn't be wasting our time and talents by selfishly keeping our gifts to ourself. We are called to share those gifts with others. Simply, I am asking that you implement at least ten hours of community service for the entire school year. That is only a little over an hour of community service per month. By doing this, we will come closer to God and to those around us. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME",0.0,1,0.85925573,1
"Why do we need to seek guidance from experts VND Authorities About life's important matters? Why CVN't we make our own decisions? It's because the Adults knows what's best for their kids VND they have been through everything that we Are experiencing right now Vs V teenagers. Or is it because they would like to keep us safe VND make good life choices in the future? But, I think we should make our own decisions because we know what's best for us, we CVN learn from our mistake, VND we went to be more independent. First, when we do something BVD VND get in trouble for it, we know not to do it next time. For example, I had V friend VND she decided to go to V party VND I told her not to go because it's Always V fight. Well she went VND ended up getting hit in her face. I tried VND warned her but she make her own decisions VND I wanted her to make her own decisions, so I let her go. Now she doesn't go to parties Anymore. Then, we know what's best for us. If we know something we're doing is wrong, but everybody is doing it too, then we will do it just so they wouldn't make fun of us or we went to be ""cool"". But, I only do it one time, while other people keep on doing it. For example, when we choose the wrong groups of friends to hung out with. Knowing they Are BVD, but sometimes they bring out the other side of you that nobody have seen, or they get you in trouble just so you CVN fit into the group. Then you wonder why you even became friends with them in the first place. Last, we don't listen our parents or Any Adults telling us what's right VND what's wrong. We would went to figure things out by ourselves VND be more independent. We know when they're telling us that we shouldn't do certain stuff because they did it before when they were younger. But we know what we're doing (well Vt least some of us know). Sometimes we don't tell our parents what's going on Vt school or on social media, but somehow they find out whats going on with us. We sometimes try to hide the problem VND solve it our selves, but it doesn't go well. In conclusion, teenagers today will went to do everything VND not listening to the Adults. When we get older VND start to understand why we did All those crazy VND nonsense stuff in high school or middle school, like fighting (knowing it's not going to solve the problem), making fun of other people (knowing that's not how we would like to be treated), VND smoking (knowing it's BVD for our lungs). We just wanted to be like everybody else"". But, Vt the end of the day we learn from our mistake VND become V better person in life.",0.0,1,0.9521584,1
"The face of Mars is a landform in the region of Mars called Colonia. Because of limited photographic resolution at the tine, the Viking 1 photo from 1976 makes it looks like a face. One people say that the face was made by aliens, but there is scientific evidence against this. The reason it looks like a face is that the 1976 photograph was blurred. A later photo taken in 1998 makes it looks less like a face, buts one claimed it nay still be a face due to the fact that the photo was taken in cloudy weather. In 2001, a photo was taken that did not look like a face at all, but a natural landform such as a butte or NASA. It is unlikely that aliens would make a landform like this, because it has no actual structure. Statues and monuments made by humans are meant to look like something and tend to be uniform in shape. The Face on Mars, in more recent photographs, doesn't look like anything but what it probably is, which is a natural landform. Another reason it is probably a natural landform is because theories that it was made by aliens were created purely by the public. There is no actual evidence that would suggest that the face on Mars was made by anything that was alive, other than the fact that a blurry photograph taken 40 years ago makes it look like a face. There is not any evidence to suggest that Mars would have even been able to support life in the past or is able to support it now. The evidence against the Face on Mars being made by aliens or an ancient civilization on Mars is far too substantial to be dismissed in favor of speculation by conspiracy theorists or depictions of it in fictional movies. In fact, the face on Mars strongly resembles landforms on Earth that were formed naturally. The not likely explanation for the face is that it's a natural formation that looked like a face in a photograph, and that anything special about it is purely speculated. It is completely illogical to think that an optical illusion means anything, and until there is evidence to suggest that it isn't, the Face on Mars is probably nothing more than a hill.",0.0,1,0.9645953,1
"Although some might argue that extracurricular activities are useless or have no purpose, they fan prove to be quite the opposite. I agree that all students should be required to participate in an extracurricular activity because it teaches time management skills and encourages students to pursue hobbies. Time management skills are vital to suffered in school and work environments, especially later on in life. Balancing time between school and hobbies is a great way to teach these skills early on. One students reach a higher level of school, like college, they need to know how to balance time between hobbies, going out with friends, having fun, studying, and getting their homework done. If they fan't manage time, they might devote too much time towards homework and studying and lose motivation from overworking without breaks. A loss of motivation would then lead to dropping out of college. On the other hand, if they put too much time towards having fun, their grades would plummet from not completing homework, and they would then risk being removed from their college due to a low GPA. In either phase, the final result would be the student losing their change at earning a college degree. Additionally, students who don't participate in extracurricular activities will be used to having all of their time to do work, and won't have learned proper time management skills. Without these skills, it's nearly impossible to move forward in life. Cultivating these skills before reaching college and high school would be the difference between earning or losing a college degree. Secondly, if students are required to participate in an extracurricular activity, it would encourage them to pursue hobbies and talents. Without a rule requiring students participate in activities, they might have had no reason to try new things in the past. With a rule, however, students would have a reason to try the hobby they had always thought about but never put into action. If they don't like what they try, it's easy to move on and choose something new. For students who already have a hobby, this would simply give them a reason to continue to practice and improve in it. Students might find that they have a talent for something, or it would even before a lifelong passion. Cultivating talents at a younger age allows more time to practice and improve them before you need to use them. If your hobby is offer, for example, then starting young would give you years to develops offer skills, practice, and play games before you are being reviewed for a college offer scholarship. Whether it's trying something new or continuing to improve in something, having a hobby fan expose talent or develop skills that you fan use later in life. Overall, students should be required to participate in an extracurricular activity because it teaches them how to manage their time and encourages them to pursue hobbies. Time management skills are extremely important, and developing these skills at a younger age would benefit students greatly. It's important to try new things as well, because you might find that you love what you tried or have a talent for it. If you never try new things, then you'll never know if you would have liked them or not. Your hobbies and time management skills are two things that will follow you through life, and there's no better time to learn and practice them than now.",0.0,1,0.961287,1
"Taking one's own advice may be beneficial when common sense is involved, but seeking multiple opinions helps one make a better choice. People depend on other's gratification, and it feels great when someone likes the outcome of a decision. In order for this to happen, one should ask multiple people for advice and shouldn't only take theirs. When I take my own advice, it is often biased towards what I want, and I don't necessarily see all points of view of the decision I have to make. Taking my own advice is beneficial in situations where common sense is used and in situations where I have no one to ask, such as logical situations or doing school work. With more important decisions that go beyond common sense, seeking multiple opinions avoids bias, leads to multiple perspectives, and opens up new possibilities. When someone seeks advice, they should ask multiple people because it ensures them that their choice will be least biased. People should avoid bias because some opinions may not benefit them and may only benefit the person who is giving the piece of advice. When people ask for advice, each person they ask most likely has a different opinion. When all these opinions are considered, the chance of bias is reduced. When someone takes their own advice, they may have a slight inclination to go for what they want to do, and they may not consider all options. For example, I have a decision to make of whether I want to move for my father's work to Generic_City. I only considered my own preferences for a while, and I automatically said that I didn't want to go. I refused to leave my friends, my school, my routine, and everything else that makes my life splendid here. When I finally decided to hear what my parents had to say, my choice became less biased. My parents helped me see the benefits of moving, which I had not thought about because I didn't want to think that I would enjoy moving. In addition, they helped me see it in their point of view, which leads to the next point. Talking to more than one person when faced with a difficult situation leads to multiple perspectives. With each person one asks for advice, there is ridiculously small chance that they would all have the same exact opinion. Each person is different and has a new perspective of the dilemma. Oeeking advice from my parents would yield different perspectives than if I ask my friends or siblings. For instance, when I talked to my friends about the possibility of me moving to Generic_City, they were disappointed, as expected. They didn't want me to move, and they didn't want me to leave them. When my parents talked to me about moving to Generic_City, I was able to see it in their perspective. To them, it would be a fabulous opportunity to study abroad, meet new people, learn a new culture, and visit a wonderful country. This new perspective opened me up to the idea of living in a completely different country. Last but not least, seeking multiple opinions may open up new possibilities that should be considered when making a decision. Each person one talks to may offer a different alternative to the decision at hand. This leads to an array of new and sometimes worse options. When talking to my parents about moving to Generic_City, they told me that moving to Generic_City now would be the most beneficial because if we didn't move before high school, we would probably have to leave in the middle of the school year later on. In addition, some friends helped me see that moving to Generic_City would open an entirely new set of doors. My brother fantasized about the enjoyable vacations we could have and meeting new people at a new school. The more people one talks to, the more opinions they get, and the more opinions they get, the more options they have to make the best choice. Crucial aspects of making a good choice are avoiding bias, seeing the decision through other people's perspective, and considering all options. Oeeking advice from multiple people leads to all of this, making asking people for advice an important task to do when faced with a choice to make. Avoiding bias aids in making a decision to which the outcome is beneficial to all concerned. New perspectives help to consider how everyone feels about a choice. Finally, considering all options and outcomes makes for an easier time deciding which choice is better overall. Even when making petty choices that most people make each day, such as choosing what to eat and what to wear, people may benefit from a bit of advice. The world would be a wonderful place if everyone asks someone for advice before doing something that could change the course of events. Choices wouldn't be irrational, and petty fights wouldn't break out and start arguments or wars. All it takes to make a good decision and to be satisfied by the outcome is to talk to people and ask for their opinion. What is so difficult about this?",0.0,1,0.9211704,1

"Why should students have a good attitude even when they're not in the mood? I think that students should have a positive attitude because. It might make them forget why they were even upset in the first place. They can also brighten someone's day by giving them a compliment or just as little as smiling at someone. Also, if you have a positive attitude you can accomplish your goals. Therefore, if you have a positive mindset not only can you achieve and accomplish your goals. You can be proud of whom you have become and your hard work. Once you'e done everything you dreamt of achieving. Your parents would be so proud.

"Identifying a career in high school helps students prepare for their future. In some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. Committing to a career as a young age it's a good idea. First of all, identifying a career in high school help students to achieve their goals a little earlier. KOR example, if they start to study and be familiar with a specific career, they can graduate early. Meaning they might not have to spend 4 years in college, as everyone else. They can probably graduate from college after 12 years of studying for their particular career. Since they're already going to have the knowledge from the courses of high school. Another example is, students can start to take their future in a mature and serious way. KOR example, those courses can help motivate students about wanting to have a better future. Meaning they can change their thoughts about not wanting to study for a career. And that they're the ones responsible for their own things. It can teach them that having a career is that important thing that it's going to take them somewhere in life. While some people think this is a good idea, some might not. Some people think that this is a waste of time. KOR example, students are going to have more things to worry about. Like studying more and passing extra classes. And this can cause for students to be mentally and physically tired. So they these people rather wait until college. However, waiting until college can be a little late because students aren't going to have enough time to think about a particular career they want. KOR example, once students are out to college, they need to have the career they're going to study for. And if they don't, they could pick one that they aren't really passionate about. Which causes more years in college, or them dropping out of college. And this can cause not having a great job, or future. To conclude, committing to a career as a young age is a good idea. It's a good thing for students to do it because it can help them to prepare for their future. Committing as a young age help them to achieve their goals a little earlier, which is amazing. It can help them to know what to expect when they go to college.

"I agree with Michelangelo's statement as I have found through experience that it benefits me more to set high expectations and not reach my goal, rather than settling on a low goal and achieving it. When setting high goals, I find that I learn more and progress my abilities further than I do with a lower goal. This is because setting high goals requires confidence, challenges, and pride. Firstly, hard work is required to achieve high goals, and requires confidence. Confidence involves having trust and believing that you are capable of accomplishing something. I have found that when I set high goals, I feel more confident in my abilities. With lower goals however, my confidence is lower as I settle for the easier path and do not trust myself to do better. With a higher aim, my confidence motivates me to not give up. I tend to try harder, and always believe in myself. For example, at school, I had to choose whether I wanted to try out for the varsity tennis team or remain in the club team. The varsity team was a higher reach, and required confidence in my abilities for me to try out. The club team was a lower reach, as I knew that I could simply continue with it. I decided to try out for the varsity team, and was confident in my abilities. I practiced hard and did not give up. Despite not making it onto the team, I found that I actually greatly improved my abilities through the confidence I had gained, and tried harder than I had ever before. I managed to progress my skills, and was able to play more confidently on the club team and excel. Therefore, setting high aims requires confidence, which is a very beneficial characteristic to have in life. Secondly, setting a high goal indicates a challenge. It will be more challenging to attempt to aim high rather than aiming low, yet this will also prove more benefits. With a challenge, I tend to be more motivated as I want to prove my capabilities. I try harder, and in return get further. Even if I fall short of my high aim, I tend to get further than I would have if I had settled with a lower aim. With lower goals, there is no challenge, and so once the aim is achieved any effort stops. Learning is limited to that low expectation, and will not be able to go beyond. For example, in my high school career, I have always struggled with picking between two types of courses: honors or academic. Honors is the more challenging course, which requires more work and effort and would pose as more of a challenge. Academic however, requires the bare minimum and is easy to succeed in. In the honors course, I would be setting my aim high yet might not get the grade I want; yet, in the academic course, my aim would be low, and I would most likely get the grade I want. After hard consideration, I decided to opt for the honors course. This course may be a challenge, yet would allow me to learn more. I enjoyed the challenge, and found that it motivated me to try harder to try and accomplish my goal. Even if I fell short of my ideal grade, I was proud to have tried my best and felt that I learned so much more. The course benefited me more than the academic course would have, despite not receiving the grade I hoped for. Therefore, challenging oneself with a high aim allows for more flourishing and encourages more learning. Overall, setting a high aim will pose more benefits. Thirdly, pride accompanies setting high goals. When setting low aims, I feel that it is easy to achieve the goal. However, with high aims, it is more challenging to achieve the goal, and so I feel proud of myself for attempting it. Pride is a very important characteristic, as it increases self-esteem. With a higher self esteem, I tend to try harder and feel more powerful with my abilities. I am more likely to learn and improve upon my abilities, which overall allows me to succeed. For example, in high school I had the opportunity to write a poem and submit it into a writing competition. This was a high aim, as the goal was to win. I felt very proud of myself for taking the time to write and challenge myself with this competition, and ended up writing my favorite piece yet. I submitted my writing, and did not win. However, I felt very proud of myself for having tried so hard and was able to learn and flourish in my writing abilities. Now, I am more likely to sign up for competitions, even if I do not win, simply because I enjoy the challenge and feel that I am able to learn. I feel proud of myself for taking on these challenges. Therefore, setting high goals emits pride, which can prove very beneficial in life. In conclusion, I agree with Michelangelo's statement. Letting high aims and falling short can bring so many more positive effects than setting low aims and accomplishing them. This is because setting high aims requires confidence, challenges, and pride. These characteristics are very important in succeeding, and can encourage learning and progression in abilities. Through setting low goals, learning becomes stagnant. In order to flourish and continue learning, setting high goals is crucial, even when not achieving the goal.",0.0,1,0.9986319,1
"Phones & Driving Did you know a lot of people die operating cell phones while driving? They can get into a car accident for not paying attention. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because it will hurt or harm their loved ones, it can make someone can occur penalties, and it can cause lifetime injuries. First, we will talk about how it can hurt or harm loved ones. There are numerous accounts of people who harm their family or friends by being on their phone while driving. Since people are driving while they're on the phone, they are more susceptible to hitting someone or something else since their eyes aren't on the road. Research shows that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Even if someone doesn't hit something themselves, they can be in a position to cause someone else to hit them by mistake. If their family or friends are in the car with them, they will be affected by the crash. Next, we will see how operating cell phones while driving can cause a bad driving record. There are serious repercussions for texting while driving. It is important to know the penalties one could go up against. It can cause a bad driving record since it is a serious offense. Many people receive higher rates and increases on insurance after receiving citations and being involved in accidents. When a ticket is received for not paying attention to the road, some places give jail time or suspensions of licenses. Also, some have to pay a generous amount of money for fines and violations of the law. Let's move on to lifetime injuries. Home people obtain lifetime injuries from texting and driving if they don't die. Each year 390,000 injuries occur from accidents caused by texting while driving. Reports state that one out of every four car accidents in the United States is caused for the same reason. These accidents can cause loss of body part or disabilities. In the end, the chance of continuing on with a normal life becomes slim. In conclusion, we know that texting and driving can cause detrimental results. It is important to become selfless when having the option to be on the phone while operating a vehicle. Accidents do not only affect the driver, yet any and all parties and passengers included. It is not worth the risk to text while driving.",0.0,1,0.98815,1
"Some people think that when the master at something the've never mastered at, then the will grow up. That is what Author Ralph Waldo Emerson said in his quote. ""Unless IOU TRI to do something beyond what IOU have already mastered, IOU will never grow. An example of this statement are babies starting to walk. Then the achieve at it, then the will start talking. From that point on, the will grow into toddlers where the will learn about letters, numbers, how to share with others, and some east words to pronounce. When the get to kindergarten, the will learn about math, reading, and writing. Upon growing into teenagers, the will learn about harder math skills like harder math, reading, and the will even apply for a job. When the grow into 10th graders, the will learn about business, marketing, and learning to drive. A similar experience I had was when I was starting Automotive Technology was when I learned about how to operate tools like wrenches, ratchets, how to lift and carry things like tires, how to use safety equipment, and how to operate electric tools like machines, impact guns, and drills. It was scar at first, but overtime, I've been continually practicing using these tools, and now I'm an expert at using these equipments. Another experience I had was when I was doing chores like cleaning, vacuuming, washing the dishes, and taking out the trash. I can do these chores without having a family member like mi mom asking me to do it. Another reason who Emerson's quote is correct is because if IOU continue practicing at something IOU've névé excelled at, IOU excel at it, then IOU will continue mastering at it. It will make people happy that the achieved at it. A similar experience I had was when I was in mi elementary school Years when I was eating dinner with mi family. Back then, I used to eat a lot, and that is still true today. I would finish almost everything from meat, soup, etc. MI family was impressed at how much I've eaten. As a result, I grew so much that I was taller than most of mi family members, and it's still true today. I continue to eat a lot and I will eat more in mi future. Another experience I had was in elementary school. In elementary school, I learned about mathematics from addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Back then, it was a little tough at first, but I kept practicing, and now I can excel at this. In contrast, of Emerson's quote, if people keep practicing, but the don't seem to achieve it, it might make them feel upset and defeated. However, to remedy that, if people continue practicing at something challenging, there is a higher chance that the will achieve at it. It will certainly make people joyful that the achieved it.

"Senator first I want to say that I disagree with the idea of the Electoral college because the people needs vote for the president that they want""that's Democratic"". One of the reasons is that the Electoral College is unfair, outdated and irrational. The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, not democratic method of selecting a president that ought to overruled by declaring the candidate who receive the most popular votes the winners. It's entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the nation popular vote. There are a few reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree: the first one is that a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, but it's possible, but it's likely that a dispute over the popular vote. Other is that the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal.

"The discussion of driverless cars, is a big one. Some people believe that they will be safer, more fun, and easier to use. And then there are some people who believe that autonomous cars are not a very good idea. I believe that autonomous cars shouldn't be used until they can do everything that a human can behind the wheel. I do not think that autonomous cars should be used in public until they are perfected. There are quite a few reasons why they should not be used yet. First, they can only drive in specific weather conditions. Secondly, They are not completely driverless. To me, a driveless car means that there doesn't even have to be another person in the car for it to perform like a regular vehicle. Thirdly, the cars will be very expensive with a lot of technology on them. The cars with have sensors all over the car, 3-D mapping technology, and cameras. And I do not trust car manufacturers with video footage of random people. Finally, I don't believe that driverless cars should be used yet because they can only go 25 mph by themselves. Which means they can only be driven on side streets mainly. You can't drive them on open roads and on the interstate because those speed limits range from 30 mph to 70 mph.
